          It depends on what you need and how competitive your market is. A complete marketing system typically starts around $3,000-$5,000/month, which includes website optimization, ad management, SEO, tracking, and daily optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, we're more expensive than some agencies. That's because we actually get results and our clients stay for years, not months. If you're looking for the cheapest option, we're probably not the right fit.

    <!-- FAQ 2 -->
    <details class="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden group">

          Month 1 is foundation—we're building the infrastructure that makes everything work. Month 2 we launch ads and leads start coming in (though it can be rough while the algorithm learns). Months 3-6 everything compounds as the algorithm optimizes and SEO kicks in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most contractors see meaningful results within 60-90 days. Anyone promising instant miracles is lying to you.

          Nope. We work month-to-month. If we're not delivering results, fire us. That's how it should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't need contracts to keep clients because what we do actually works. Our clients stay with us for years because they're getting leads and closing jobs, not because they're legally obligated to stick around.

          Everything works together: conversion-optimized website design, Google Ads and Meta Ads management, Local Service Ads setup, local SEO, Google Business Profile optimization, conversion tracking, monthly reporting, and daily campaign optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't a la carte services. It's a complete system where every piece supports the others. Website gets traffic from ads and SEO. Ads convert better because the website is optimized. SEO compounds over time. Everything is tracked so we know what's working.

          Yes. We work with contractors across the country. Local marketing isn't about being physically nearby—it's about understanding local search behavior, local competition, and how to dominate your specific service area.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've helped plumbers in Seattle, HVAC companies in Dallas, roofers in Atlanta, and electricians in Phoenix. The fundamentals of contractor marketing are the same. The execution is customized to your market.

          We build complete systems, not individual services. Most agencies sell you a website OR SEO OR Google Ads and wonder why you're not getting results. We integrate everything so it works together.

        <p class="mb-4">
          We tell you the truth about timelines and what works. No fake guarantees. No "rank #1 in 30 days" BS. Just honest marketing that generates predictable leads.

          We're partners, not vendors. If something's not working, we figure out why and fix it—together. We own our results.

          Honestly, probably not. We're not set up for one-off projects because they don't deliver the results you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          A website alone doesn't generate leads without traffic. Google Ads alone don't convert without an optimized website. SEO alone takes too long without ads to fill the gap. Everything works together—that's the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you just need a quick website built, there are cheaper options out there. We're here for contractors who want a complete lead generation system that actually works.

          We focus on service-based businesses where lead quality matters more than lead volume. Jobs where the average ticket is high enough to justify proper marketing investment. Industries where Google search and local visibility drive real revenue.
