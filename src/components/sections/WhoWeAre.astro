    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-600 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
      We're not your typical marketing agency. We don't hide behind jargon, fake guarantees, or corporate BS. We're the rebels who actually tell you the truth about what works and what doesn't.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Most agencies sell you a website, or SEO, or Google Ads—then wonder why you're not getting results.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We build complete lead generation systems where everything works together: conversion-optimized website + targeted paid ads + local SEO + Google Business Profile optimization + tracking and daily optimization.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Individual tactics fail. Systems generate predictable leads.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We're not an agency you pay to run ads while you hope for the best. We're your marketing team. We own our results.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If something's not working, we figure out why and fix it—together. That's what partners do.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Most agencies blame your market or your industry when campaigns underperform. We test, adjust, and optimize until it works.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Yeah, we use AI as a tool. But humans drive the strategy. Every contractor business is different. Every market is different.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We don't pump out generic content that could work for anyone—we build messaging and positioning specifically for your business.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Most agencies use baseline AI without training or customization. The result? Generic sameness that doesn't build brands or differentiate you from competitors.
