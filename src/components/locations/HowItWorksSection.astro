        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Month 1: Foundation</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          We're not building a skyscraper on soft dirt. Month 1 is about creating the infrastructure—website optimization, tracking setup, Google Business Profile, and initial campaign structure. No leads yet, but we're building the system that generates them.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Month 2-3: Launch & Learn</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Google Ads launch and leads start flowing. The algorithm is learning, so month 2 can be rough. We're gathering data, testing messaging, and optimizing based on what's actually working. This is where patience pays off.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Month 4+: Compound Results</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The algorithm has learned. SEO starts kicking in. Your Google Business Profile is ranking. Everything compounds. Lead costs go down. Lead quality goes up. This is when the system proves itself.
