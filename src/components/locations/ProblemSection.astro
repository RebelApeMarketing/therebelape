          Why {city} Contractors Struggle to Get Consistent Leads
        </h2>

          <p>
            You rely on word-of-mouth and referrals. Some months are great. Some months are slow. You can't control the lead flow, which means you can't control growth. You've probably tried marketing before—maybe an agency that didn't deliver, maybe DIY that took too much time. Either way, you're still here looking for something that actually works.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's the truth: most contractors in {city} have the same problem. It's not unique to your business. You're not doing anything wrong. The marketing agencies selling you services just aren't building complete systems that actually generate consistent revenue.
