## Rebel Ape Marketing — Service Agreement Terms

**Last Updated:** February 2026

## 1. Engagement

By paying your first invoice, you ("Client") engage Rebel Ape Marketing LLC ("Rebel Ape") as an independent marketing consultant to perform the services outlined in your Program Overview. Your Program Overview and these Service Agreement Terms together form the complete agreement ("Agreement") between Client and Rebel Ape.

## 2. Term & Commitment Options

**Month-to-Month:** This Agreement continues on a month-to-month basis with no long-term commitment. Either party may terminate with 30 days written notice.

**12-Month Commitment:** If Client selects the 12-month option, the Agreement runs for a full 12 months from the effective date, after which it continues on a month-to-month basis. The 12-month commitment includes a waived setup fee in exchange for the full-term commitment. Early termination of a 12-month commitment is addressed in Section 10.

Rebel Ape may terminate this Agreement immediately if (i) Client fails to pay any fees when due, (ii) Client ceases to cooperate with Rebel Ape or otherwise makes it unreasonably difficult for Rebel Ape to perform services, or (iii) Rebel Ape discovers that Client is utilizing its website or marketing materials for any purpose that violates federal, state, or local law.

## 3. Fees & Payment

Client agrees to pay all fees outlined in the Program Overview when due. The first monthly fee is due upon acceptance of this Agreement (payment of the first invoice). All subsequent monthly fees are due on the same calendar day of each following month.

If any fee is not paid within 30 days of its due date, all services will be paused immediately until the balance is resolved. Once paid, all fees are nonrefundable.

Rebel Ape reserves the right to adjust monthly fees with 45 days written notice to Client.

## 4. Ad Spend

Client is responsible for all advertising spend paid directly to advertising platforms (Google Ads, Meta, etc.). Ad budgets are separate from Rebel Ape's management fees and are outlined in the Program Overview. Each advertising platform maintains its own terms of service, billing policies, and account requirements that are independent of this Agreement. Client is responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms.

Ad campaigns launch once setup is complete — typically 2-3 weeks after kickoff, depending on platform approval and verification processes. Client is not billed for ad spend until campaigns are live.

Client is responsible for all outstanding balances with advertising platforms, including any balances remaining upon termination of this Agreement.

## 5. Client Authorization

Client authorizes Rebel Ape to:

- **(i)** Access Client's website to analyze, modify, and optimize its content and structure for the purposes of search engine optimization and lead generation.
- **(ii)** Upload content, pages, and other materials to Client's website as deemed appropriate for marketing purposes.
- **(iii)** Use Client's logos, trademarks, images, and branding materials to create marketing content and perform services under this Agreement.
- **(iv)** Communicate with third parties as necessary to perform services, including but not limited to web hosting providers, advertising platforms, and directory listings.
- **(v)** Post content to Client's social media accounts, Google Business Profile, and other online profiles as outlined in the Program Overview.

## 6. Call Tracking & Recording

Client consents to the placement of tracking phone numbers on Client's website and marketing materials, and to the recording of all calls routed through those tracking numbers.

Tracking numbers remain active for 30 days following termination to allow Client to port them to the provider of their choice. Any fees associated with porting or activating numbers with a new provider are the responsibility of the Client.

## 7. Pay-Per-Click Campaigns & Intellectual Property

All Google Ads campaigns, including but not limited to campaign structure, keyword strategies, ad copy, landing pages, and associated marketing materials created by Rebel Ape are the intellectual property of Rebel Ape.

Client may review campaign performance through reports and shared screen sessions with a member of the Rebel Ape team. Direct account access to Google Ads campaigns will not be provided during or after the term of this Agreement.

**Google Local Service Ads (GLSA):** GLSA accounts are owned by the Client, as they are tied to Client's business verification, licensing, and background checks. Rebel Ape manages GLSA campaigns on Client's behalf during the term of this Agreement, but the account itself remains Client's property.

## 8. Website Ownership & Hosting

**During the Agreement:** Rebel Ape typically transfers Client's website to our managed servers as part of onboarding, unless there is a strong technical reason to keep the website on its current host. In some cases, the migration process may cause brief downtime or minor disruptions while the transfer is completed. Website hosting on Rebel Ape's servers is included at no additional charge during the term of the Agreement. Email hosting is not included. If Client requires email hosting (email@yourdomain.com), that can be configured through Client's IT provider or a provider recommended by Rebel Ape at an additional cost paid directly to that provider.

**Website Ownership — Month-to-Month Clients:** The website becomes Client's property once development is complete. Upon termination, Client may take their website files as outlined in Section 10.

**Website Ownership — 12-Month Commitment Clients:** Because the setup fee was waived, Client earns ownership of the website upon completion of all 12 monthly payments. If Client terminates before completing 12 months of payments, website ownership is addressed in Section 10.

## 9. Content Updates & Design Changes

Unless otherwise specified in the Program Overview, Client is entitled to a set number of content update requests per month as outlined in their program. If Client requests revisions beyond the agreed-upon scope, additional revisions will be charged at Rebel Ape's current hourly rate. Contact Rebel Ape for details.

## 10. Termination & Transition

**30-Day Notice:** All terminations require 30 days written notice from either party. During the 30-day period, Rebel Ape will continue to perform services, and Client remains responsible for that month's fees.

**Month-to-Month Termination:** Client provides 30 days notice and walks away clean. Website files and database are provided to Client for self-migration. Tracking numbers are ported to Client upon request, provided all fees are paid in full.

**12-Month Early Termination:** If Client terminates before completing the 12-month commitment, Client's final invoice will include the $750 setup fee that was originally waived. Website ownership transfers to Client once this final payment is made.

**Post-Termination Website Hosting:** After termination, Client has 30 days to migrate their website to another host. Options include:

- **(i)** Pay Rebel Ape $50/month for continued hosting.
- **(ii)** Request a complete backup of website files and database to migrate independently or through Client's own IT provider.

If Client has not migrated within 30 days and has not arranged continued hosting, all website files, hosting, applications, advertising accounts, call tracking numbers, and any other assets managed by Rebel Ape will be permanently deleted from our platforms and are not recoverable.

**Post-Termination Responsibility:** Once the website is transferred, Client or their third-party provider assumes full responsibility for the website, including but not limited to WordPress updates, plugin compatibility, hosting, security, and ongoing functionality. Rebel Ape is not liable for any issues arising after transfer.

## 11. No Guaranteed Results

Client acknowledges and agrees to the following:

- **(i)** Rebel Ape does not and cannot guarantee specific search engine rankings, lead volumes, or revenue outcomes. Marketing results depend on numerous factors outside of Rebel Ape's control, including but not limited to market conditions, competition, search engine algorithm changes, and Client's own business operations such as sales processes, close rates, and customer experience.
- **(ii)** Search engines may change algorithms, drop listings, or alter ranking criteria at any time without notice.
- **(iii)** SEO results typically take 6-8 months to compound. PPC results begin once campaigns launch but improve over time as campaigns are optimized.
- **(iv)** Rebel Ape will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the best possible results within Client's budget and market conditions, and will communicate transparently about what is and isn't working.

## 12. Client Representations

Client represents and warrants that:

- **(i)** Client owns the domain name and website associated with this Agreement.
- **(ii)** Client owns or has the unrestricted right to use all graphics, photos, designs, and content provided to Rebel Ape for use in marketing services.

Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Rebel Ape and its owners, employees, and contractors from any liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from any breach of these representations.

If Client is a business entity, the individual accepting this Agreement represents that they have full authority to bind the Client.

## 13. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah. Any disputes arising from this Agreement will be resolved through binding arbitration in the State of Utah in accordance with standard commercial arbitration rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

## 14. Miscellaneous

This Agreement may not be assigned by Client without Rebel Ape's prior written consent.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Client and Rebel Ape regarding the services described herein and supersedes all prior communications, whether oral or written.

No modification to these terms is valid unless made in writing and agreed to by both parties.

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.

Rebel Ape shall not be liable for delays or failure to perform due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control (force majeure).

## 15. Acceptance

By paying your first invoice, Client acknowledges that they have read and agree to these Service Agreement Terms and the Program Overview provided by Rebel Ape Marketing.

**No signature is required. Payment constitutes acceptance.**
