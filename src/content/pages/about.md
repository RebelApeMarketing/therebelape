## We Don't Promise Leads. We Deliver Them.

Every agency says the same thing. We'll grow your business. We'll generate leads. We'll transform your marketing. Then you get a dashboard full of vanity metrics that look impressive but don't move the needle on your actual business.

We're different because we're honest about what we control and what we don't.

## The Reality of Marketing Agencies

We've been in this space long enough to see the pattern. Agencies hide behind inflated numbers. They take credit for sales they didn't make. They optimize for metrics that sound good in a report—not metrics that actually grow your business.

At Rebel Ape Marketing, we focus on one thing: lead generation. Specifically, we build and refine the channels that actually work for home service companies. Websites. Landing pages. Paid ads. That's it.

Why? Because after years of testing every channel under the sun, we learned that most of them are noise. Social feeds are cluttered. SEO is drowning in AI-generated content. New channels emerge constantly. But the fundamentals? They don't change.

## Our Story: From Full Service to Laser Focus

A few years back, I partnered with someone and we grew XYZ Marketing (yes, that was the name) quickly. We had great clients—many are still with us today. But we learned a hard lesson: full-service means stretched thin. Everyone running in a million directions. No focus. No real impact.

When my business partner left to start something new, I took the win: I absorbed what worked from XYZ Marketing and killed everything else. We dove deep into the analytics of hundreds of campaigns and asked one question: What actually matters?

The answer was humbling. Almost nothing. And as AI reshaped the landscape, even fewer things mattered.

So we doubled down. We stopped offering everything. We started offering only what works.

## How We Work

You come to us doing $500K to $1M in revenue, mostly through referrals or DIY ads that barely move the dial. We build you a real lead acquisition system—one that works consistently month after month.

But here's what most agencies won't tell you: leads don't close themselves. When we deliver leads, many of them get lost in your sales process. So we help you identify the holes—in your follow-up, your nurturing, your sales, your post-sale. We help you fix those. Because better leads mean nothing if your team can't convert them.

The result? You go from worrying about whether your Facebook page has the right post to actually hitting the channels that matter. You stop guessing. You start building.

## Our Promise

We're not here to impress you with a beautiful dashboard. We're here to grow your business—and ours depends on growing yours.

If the leads aren't coming, we tell you. If something isn't working, we say so and we fix it. If the problem is on your end—sales, follow-up, systems—we tell you that too. No hiding. No false metrics. No partnership with hidden agendas.

The better you do, the better we do. That's how this works.
