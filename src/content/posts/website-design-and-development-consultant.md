## Ways To Improve

Continuous [improvement is crucial because even website](https://therebelape.com/blog/on-page-seo-tips/) specialists find it difficult to keep up with these changes. A website design and development consultant can assist in these areas.

### Determine the sources of the traffic that your competitors are receiving

You may generally compare the [traffic to your website](https://therebelape.com/blog/content-syndication-strategies/) with any other website using tools like Alexa or SimilarWeb. These tools can give you a variety of suggestions for competing with your competitors by revealing some of the keywords for which they are generating traffic.

### Find fresh keyword ideas

Has Google Search Console been used? This tool reveals the terms visitors used to find your website. Use it to find keywords for which you already have a ranking but could do with some help.

Google Keyword Planner might be useful. A component of the Google Ads advertising system is Keyword Planner. It can be used for free to find the terms with high search demand. The benefit of using a keyword planner is that it will display popular search terms that are related to the ones you entered but that you had no idea people were using to find your goods and services.

Your website's pages' TITLE, META, and H1 text should be revised.

### So-called on-site search engine optimization is this

You may sometimes give a website page a slight boost on Google only by adding a target keyword to the TITLE, META DESCRIPTION, and H1 tags. Not a lot, but it's still worthwhile to do this in 2024.

You can probably modify the tags yourself if your website is powered by a content management system like WordPress or one comparable to it (just ask your website developers for access).

### Select the Products and Website Pages for Online Advertising

The top prospects should be chosen to be promoted in those ads if you're thinking about using advertising to increase traffic. Not all goods and services make effective marketing candidates.

Products that are not in high demand, for instance, might not draw a lot of customers. Similar to this, it is not a good idea to direct traffic to websites that are not set up to accept it because you will end up losing money.

### Read and understand the Google Ads (AdWords) reports that your agency sends you

A lot of businesses never read the monthly advertising reports that their advertising agency sends them, and they never ask the agency to explain the findings. This is where a website design and development consultant can really become valuable. The basic explanation is that firms often feel embarrassed to inquire about the implications of the data in these reports for their operations.

If that describes your business, we advise setting up a monthly call with your advertising firm to discuss data interpretation. The knowledge you will gain is priceless, even if the agency charges you more for this (which they will if they're savvy).

### Increase the Results Your Advertising Agency Produces

Clients and their advertising companies frequently argue and end up severing their relationship when advertisements fail to produce leads, sales, and results. When you think about the following details, it makes sense why this occurs: The cost of advertising is increasing, landing sites for paid visitors require constant tuning and enhancement, and ad copy and ad graphics want ongoing creative input.

The likelihood that your connection with an agency may at some point become strained increases the less you understand how online advertising functions. Let's not act as though clients don't frequently make unreasonable requests without realizing it. Not all agencies have the know-how to effectively convey what is attainable.

Clients dislike it when, for the same price they first agreed upon, they continue to receive a decreasing number of clicks on their ads. The customer feels duped, terminates the partnership, and occasionally vows never to engage in advertising again if the agency fails to explain why this occurs and what to do about it (which is a shame).

Advertising rarely succeeds without your, the client, input. You shouldn't hire an advertising agency, set it on autopilot, and walk away from it. You will need to set up some sort of educated oversight over what the agency is doing to make advertising work for you if you want to make money off of those ads.
