This pandemic has struck fear into many people, for good reason. The economy has essentially come to a standstill as the virus has shut down many businesses in an attempt to protect the general public and slow the spread of the virus.

So how do you keep your businesses relevant and functioning through these dark times, especially when you can’t open your doors?

Hidden opportunities exist even in hard times. Leveraging the available internet tools can significantly enhance your business during the pandemic and enable you to overcome the challenges posed by it more effectively.

## Build Your Website. It’s The HUB Of All Communication for Your Business During the Pandemic

The vast majority of people turn to the internet to find businesses to purchase from or do business with. This is even more common while people are quarantined inside of their homes. This means that building your website is an important part of helping your business to keep going during this pandemic.

The more content that is available on your website, the more often potential customers will find your website. This means that it is an important time to add to the content on your website.

Blogging is a valuable tool in expanding the&nbsp;[content of your website](https://therebelape.com/blog/content-syndication-strategies/). Now is the time to start&nbsp;[blogging](https://therebelape.com/blog/a-website-blog-is-an-seos-secret-weapon/)&nbsp;and blog like crazy to expand your website and keep your business during the pandemic as much as possible.

## Add Sales Funnels. These Can Be Hidden Gems For Leads and Sales.

Sales funnels can be incredibly beneficial additions to your website.

So what is a sales funnel?

Essentially, a sales funnel is a page that operates with the sole intent to do one thing, and accomplish that task particularly well. For example, some sales funnels are intended to build your email list, while others may be designed to sell a product or promote a webinar.

Adding sales funnels to your website can go a long way toward aiding in various functions of your business during the pandemic.

## Focus on Building The Email List for Your Business During the Pandemic.

Speaking of sales funnels, now is a great time to focus on building your email list. This can help you to more effectively communicate with your clients and advertise for specific events or products.

An effective way to build your email list is by giving away something that you have that people want. Make sure that you make it valuable and appealing to customers, rather than just providing a sales piece. This can substantially help to draw customers in. &nbsp;

## Make Some Noise On Social Media. It’s Easy To Be The Loudest When Everyone Is Whispering.

Everyone emphasizes the power of social media, which is why you likely have heard it over and over again. This is because it is an effective way to promote your business. [Social media](https://therebelape.com/blog/create-social-media-marketing-campaign/) is free advertising for your business, but you shouldn’t try to promote to your family and friends.

Go into a group on a social media site and offer responses with real value. This can go a long way toward improving the image of your company and building your customer base keeping your business during the pandemic.

## Establish your Brand And Build Trust.

Your brand is an incredibly important aspect of your business. An effective brand will help to get your name out and improve the image that customers have of your company. You should strive to promote your brand anywhere possible in order to increase awareness of your company.

Establishing a solid&nbsp;[brand image](https://therebelape.com/blog/what-is-a-brand-promise/)&nbsp;is important in increasing the satisfaction and loyalty of your customers. This means that you need to stay consistent with the colors, fonts, logos, messages, vibe, and additional factors of your website and business’s marketing strategies.&nbsp;

When you focus on establishing a solid brand, you will have more control over the image of your company. This can go a long way toward improving your customer base and building relationships with your customers ensuring your business during the pandemic.

If you don’t feel like your company has a great,&nbsp;[well-established brand](https://therebelape.com/blog/branding-strategies-in-marketing/), you should strive to take the steps to outline your brand and ensure that it is cohesive across the board. Our expert services can help guide you throughout this process.&nbsp;

## Use That Email List, Even If It’s Brand New!

Do you have or are working on building an email list? Now is an incredibly beneficial time to start making use of it. Send out emails to your customer base to ensure that you remain at the front of their minds. However, it is important to not make every email a sales pitch. The emails you send can include various messages for your customers to keep the online presence of your business during the pandemic.

Send value, information, tips, tricks, and more. *Then*&nbsp;ask for a sale, rather than focusing primarily on the sales pitch. This is incredibly important to ensure that your customers find value in your emails, rather than simply hitting the “unsubscribe” button.&nbsp;
