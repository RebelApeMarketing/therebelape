<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to Hire a Professional Videographer: Equipment Considerations</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modern smartphones can capture impressive video for certain marketing purposes like social media updates and behind-the-scenes content. However, for brand videos, commercials, and cornerstone content, professional equipment makes a significant difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, you can buy professional equipment yourself, but you should consider the cost of even the most basic professional setup. As you'll find, production can get expensive very quickly. There's no guarantee that you'll make enough money to cover the cost of the equipment, even if you manage to drive traffic to your product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Professional videographers have a passion for their work and they purchase the right equipment to back it up:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A professional videographer has the equipment and knowledge to make your product stand out. This means you don't have to start over whenever a take doesn't go as planned.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Instead of spending a lot of cash on equipment that might not work for you, a videographer knows which tools to use. Plus it will only cost a fraction of the price of purchasing the equipment on your own.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>There are a wide range of video tools out there. You don't have to understand them all, only to realize that you got the wrong lens. Videographers know what they need to get the desired effect already.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of spending precious money on equipment that you might not use, call in a video expert for your high-stakes content. You can get your money's worth without breaking the bank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When Your Smartphone is the Right Tool</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For certain video types, your phone is not just adequate but often preferable:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Quick social media updates and stories</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Time-sensitive content that needs to be published quickly</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Behind-the-scenes glimpses that benefit from an authentic feel</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Regular, high-volume content like tips and quick announcements</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>When your budget is better allocated to content frequency rather than production value</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key is using your smartphone strategically and optimizing its capabilities:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Invest in a simple external microphone for vastly improved audio</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Use natural lighting or inexpensive ring lights</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Keep shots stable with a basic tripod or gimbal</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Professional Videographer Knows What Captures Attention</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Professional videography is more than picking up the camera and hitting record. It is a combination of planning, shooting, reshooting, editing, sound, and color. Not only does it take research, but also time that you could be devoting towards improving your business. With a videographer on your team for important projects, you don't have to worry about which size lens does what. They've got you covered already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For cornerstone content that represents your brand, attempting DIY video might mean you spent all that time, money, and effort for underwhelming results. How much would that end up costing you in time and effort that could be spent on building your&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/">business</a>&nbsp;instead?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>With a professional videographer, you can get a high-quality product the first time for your most important videos</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Videographers know how to use angles, colors, and sound to create the strongest emotions in customers, persuading them to buy</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Professional videographers draw from countless hours of experience and study, and you get the benefit of their craft for critical marketing assets</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't scroll through competitors' professionally-produced videos in envy when you can have amazing brand videos of your own by utilizing the right people. You don't have to be a video expert; we've got that covered. All you have to do is contact&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/about-rebel-ape-marketing/">Rebel Ape Marketing</a>&nbsp;and watch as we craft the videos that showcase your unique voice and products.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Videos Are Essential To Growth As A Business</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the emergence of TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and social media stories, video is everywhere. You cannot afford to ignore video as a part of your marketing strategy. Statistics show that companies that use video content have greater potential for growth and success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Viewers claim that they remember 95% of a brand message they see on video, compared to only 10% when reading text</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>More than half of online customers decide what brand or service provider they should choose because of video content</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Video ads are consistently ranked as the #1 way new customers discover local businesses</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p>So what does this mean for your business?
