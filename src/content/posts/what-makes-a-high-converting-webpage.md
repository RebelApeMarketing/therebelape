<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A high converting webpage is to drive traffic to make a sale or complete some type of action like filling out a form. A high converting <meta charset="utf-8">website is to replace or supplement a traditional business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to creating a high converting <meta charset="utf-8">website, there are a few crucial elements to consider. These elements can be the difference between converting traffic into customers or not. Let's explore some of these elements and how to put them in place to start converting traffic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we dig into these elements, not everything needs to be on a website, but having many of these items can help. Even with that said, some of these items, like trustworthiness, are crucial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few of the elements that make up a <a href="https://therebelape.com/high-converting-website-design-guide/">high converting website</a> are the following:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A high converting webpage should have a professional web design.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every single page on your website that a customer may visit needs to have a goal. Without a goal, the chances of a conversion drop. There is no reason to have information on the web page without it serving a purpose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href="https://therebelape.com/how-to-outrank-your-competitors/">strategies</a> behind the website are the reason why a website works or not. The <a href="https://therebelape.com/video-marketing-strategy-for-2023/">marketing strategy</a> will emphasize web design. So, there is more to a website than selecting a theme. Though it may be beautiful, it doesn't mean that it will convert. This is why there are some very ugly websites that convert very well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When considering what should go into the strategy behind a website, there are a few items to consider. Those items are layout, unity, and brand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The website layout is an essential element when it comes to <a href="https://therebelape.com/web-design/" data-type="link" data-id="https://therebelape.com/web-design/">website design.</a> This section will be the roadmap on how the users navigate the website and will guide them to each element. By having an effective layout, users move through the website as you wish them to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within the website layout, you need to create unity throughout the site which helps the brand. What this means is that the website, images, and other content all match. The looks, colors, and vibe of the <a href="https://therebelape.com/how-your-website-design-can-help-or-hurt-your-brand/">website all help enforce the brand</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When these elements come together, you begin to build trust. With trust, you influence users to become fans of your brand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A website won't convert traffic if it isn't trustworthy.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trust is a huge factor when it comes to converting traffic. When a user visits the website, unless they had the intent to visit, they are usually cold traffic. This means they have yet to know your brand and they haven't yet been pre-sold. Without the website creating that trust, it's unlikely this traffic will convert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few elements that can add trust that can help with adding trust. Though trust comes from many areas such as content, images, and brand, a few others are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Add partner logos to the website.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the most powerful items are logos from other <a href="https://therebelape.com/success-business-branding/">brands your company does business</a> with. These can also be awards won and other logo-based items. Logos show that you are an actual company and work with other brands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parter logos added to a website may be in a simple row, grid, or carousel. It doesn't matter how they display as long as they can show users the trust they hold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use testimonials to build trust.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to build trust on the website is to include client testimonials. These are people who have likely purchased services from your company. They are the best to show others that they can trust you. It shows that these people have done business with you already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nobody wants to be the first to try a product or service. By showcasing 5-star reviews on pages that relate to the product or service, you can help add trust. Even if the reviews aren't 5-stars, by adding them helps build trust. This allows people to see how others feel about your service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use case studies to show proof of success.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another very useful element to add trust to your website is to show case studies. These are outlines of the success you have had with other <a href="https://therebelape.com/clients/">clients</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of case studies can be proof of how your products and services have benefited others. If possible, include high-resolution photos in the case studies. Text-based content about the project further adds trust. This information shows how your company helped others achieve success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the basics when it comes to high converting webpage design. Once you have these in place, you can begin to focus on high-level conversions. These are analytics that happen when users visit your website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A phone number is one of the best items for a high converting webpage.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An overlooked high conversion webpage <a href="https://therebelape.com/phone-number-on-your-website/">item is the phone number</a>. It can often be one of the best converting features you have. The phone number can help in a few ways. First, it acts as a trust builder. Having a phone number on the website shows users that you are a company with high standards. A company that holds service in the highest regard. It also gives them the ability to reach you whenever they like and there is<br>Though the phone number added anywhere helps, one of the best places is the top right of the website. This is often one of the primary high converting items.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another high-converting location is at the bottom of the website in the footer. Placing the phone number at the bottom allows users to locate it if they've made it through all the content. If they now want to contact you, it's easy to find out how.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On top of that, it gives users a great way to contact you and also helps with localization. If you are a local company, showing a local number shows you are currently working in that area. Some users will want you to be local to do business with your company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Add Call-To-Actions Throughout The Website.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To <a href="https://therebelape.com/on-page-seo-tips/">optimize your website's</a> conversion rate, it is crucial to have call-to-actions scattered throughout the website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But how can you write strong call-to-actions that inspire your visitors to take action?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to Write Strong Call-To-Actions</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A high converting webpage loads fast.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine clicking on a website and waiting for an eternity for the page to load. It's frustrating, annoying, and can make you want to give up altogether. In today's digital age, website visitors don't have the patience to wait around. That's why having a fast-loading website has become more important than ever, and not just to keep people on your site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>A fast website equals high conversion rates: Fact or Fiction?</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fact! As Google releases its Core Web Vitals, it's clear that faster website loading speed leads to higher conversion rates. We're not talking about small increases either. Our team has seen changes of up to 20% on already well-established sites. On some older websites, when we switched hosting providers to top-tier hosts, we saw up to a staggering 700% improvement in conversion rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>So, what are Core Web Vitals?</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google has released code that judges a website based on important vitals. The website aspects they focus on range from the Cumulative Layout Shifts (CLS) to the Time To First Byte (TTFB). This means it's vital to have a website that loads faster than ever. Google wants to see these web vitals on every site, and it's vital for high-ranking websites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But don't worry, you don't have to be an expert in coding to improve your website speed. One of the easiest solutions is using a fast web host. Upgrading from a budget host to a top-tier host can significantly speed up your website. Many hosting companies will even migrate your website for free upon signing up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dwell time on site matters. In other words, keep people on your site longer.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You want to make sure people stay on your website longer and don't leave quickly. The longer they stay, the better it is for your website. When people stay on your site and don't leave to visit other sites, it increases the chances of turning them into customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dwell time is really important because it shows how good your content is. If visitors spend a good amount of time on your site, it tells search engines that your website has valuable stuff. So, your website will show up higher in search results. In simple terms, more dwell time means more people see your website, and you get more visitors from search engines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some tips to increase your website's dwell time:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Provide High-Quality Content:</strong> Your website's content should be engaging, informative, and relevant. Always aim for quality over quantity!</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Improve Website Navigation:</strong> An easy-to-use website helps visitors find what they're looking for, increasing the time they spend on your site.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Optimize for Mobile</strong>: A mobile-ready website is a must-have! With more users accessing websites via mobile devices, it's crucial to ensure your site is responsive and mobile-friendly.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Add Videos and Images:</strong> People love visuals! Incorporate videos and images into your content to make it more engaging and interactive.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Use Internal Linking: </strong>Adding internal links to relevant content on your website helps visitors navigate and explore more of your site. Plus, it's great for <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://therebelape.com/seo/" title="SEO" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">SEO</a>!</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Optimize your images to further improve loading speed.</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fast-loading<a href="https://therebelape.com/on-page-seo-tips/"> website increases dwell times and also aids in SEO</a>. This will allow your website to bring in more traffic. The more traffic your website brings in, the more opportunity for conversions.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can decrease the file size of<a href="https://therebelape.com/pitfalls-of-stock-photography-for-website-images/"> images to further speed up your website</a>. The optimal file sizes for images depend on how much traffic your site receives. You should aim for smaller than 1MB to improve load times. It’s best to have an image as small as possible. We strive for as few kilobits as possible.</p>

<p>Google says that reducing image file types is one of the best ways to increase page loading speeds.<br>If you are not familiar with image compression software, don’t worry. There are many free or paid tools available to help decrease the size of your images. One of these programs is TinyPNG which can reduce image file sizes by an average of 54%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can decrease your image file size by resizing your images before uploading them. The general rule when resizing is to keep the longest side under 1000 pixels on average. unless your site calls for something specific, follow this practice. If you know the largest size an image will be, you can match that size. If you need help with optimizing your website, contact us.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's be honest, convincing people to do business with you is tough when they don't know you. Plus, it's a great idea to become the go-to expert in your area and nearby cities. When it comes to doing this online, there are two key tools: localization and geodata.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What's Localization?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Localization means tailoring your website and marketing to fit the needs and tastes of a specific place. This can include using local language, images, pricing, deals, and other things that connect with the people you're trying to reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Does Localization Matter?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good sitemap shows your site’s hierarchy. It makes sure there is nothing missed or not linked. This allows for better crawling and indexing by Google bots. Don’t overlook the importance of sitemaps. Without it, Google may not index your website. Or index only a small amount which would make it hard for your customers to find you.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the previous section, we mentioned opt-in forms. These opt-in forms often will drive a user to enter their name and email. But how do you get them to do that? The simple answer is, to give something away for free. There are a variety of ways you can offer freebies on your website, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Digital downloads</strong> - This could be anything from a free eBook to a printable checklist or a sample of your services.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Entry into a drawing</strong> - Consider offering a prize that is relevant to your business. For example, if you run a pet store, you could give away a gift card or a free pet grooming session.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Free trial or demo</strong> - This is an excellent option for software or service-based companies. Offer a free trial or demo of your product, and make it easy for visitors to sign up.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>For example: don’t go giving away free teddy bears if you’re an accountant dealing with tax returns.<br>This may not be the most obvious way of gaining new leads but it works well.</p>
