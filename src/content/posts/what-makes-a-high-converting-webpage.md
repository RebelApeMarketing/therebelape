Localization means tailoring your website and marketing to fit the needs and tastes of a specific place. This can include using local language, images, pricing, deals, and other things that connect with the people you're trying to reach.

- **Digital downloads** - This could be anything from a free eBook to a printable checklist or a sample of your services.
