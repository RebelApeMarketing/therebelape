You may need to add users to Google My Business to unlock the full range of benefits for your business.

Optimizing your Google My Business (GMB) listing can [boost your SEO](https://therebelape.com/seo/) and help your business rank higher in search results — especially in Google Maps. Your GMB profile allows you to add photos and videos, publish posts, answer questions, and share important updates that generate interest and trust.

There are many elements involved in properly optimizing a Google My Business account, and user access is a critical one.

## Getting Started With Google My Business

All information in your Google My Business listing must be accurate. Your **business name, address, and phone number (NAP)** are especially important.

You should:

- Avoid duplicate listings
- Keep your profile as complete as possible
- Update an existing profile rather than creating a new one

Regular maintenance is required because Google allows users to suggest edits. It’s important to review these updates to ensure all information about your business remains accurate.

Users can also submit answers to questions, so you’ll want to monitor those regularly as well.

---

### Update Your Information

Google allows users to suggest updates to your listing. You should review these changes frequently to ensure accuracy.

Users can also answer questions in the Q&A section, and incorrect answers can mislead potential customers if they’re not reviewed.
