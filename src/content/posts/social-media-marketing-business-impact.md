In an increasingly tech-savvy world, social media has weaved itself into our lives in ways we would never have thought possible. Just as it has provided opportunities like never before to connect with one another, it has also provided a brand new platform on which to market your business. As its popularity soars, businesses must recognize the imperative of engaging in&nbsp;**social media marketing**.

Let's be honest, in many ways, social media is the new "getting up in the morning and reading the paper." For most people, they start off each day opening up one of the many platforms and scrolling through photos, videos, and status updates, completely inundated with likes, comments, and shares.

It has only grown since it first started, and it hasn't shown signs of slowing down, which is why many companies have seen it as an opportunity to promote themselves on a whole other platform.

Some businesses, however, tend to see&nbsp;**social media marketing**&nbsp;as expendable, a side of marketing that won't really have an effect on their overall profitability. But in reality, avoiding social media could be holding you back from gaining customers.

## Is Your Target Audience Using Social Media Marketing Platforms? Survey Says: Yes

Certain business owners resist engaging in&nbsp;**social media marketing**, fearing it might be fruitless. Surprisingly, almost 40% of small businesses avoid using social media in their marketing efforts, according to recent studies.

Perhaps past attempts yielded underwhelming outcomes, leading to the assumption that their audience isn't present. Alternatively, they might have acquired more business through word of mouth than through likes and shares.

Regardless of the rationale, some businesses abstain from&nbsp;**social media marketing**&nbsp;under the assumption that their audience lacks activity there. Yet, the statistics tell a different story:

- Studies show that as of 2025, over 4.5 billion people globally use at least one social media platform. That is 1.5 billion more than in 2017. And there are estimates that there will be as many as 5 billion users by 2028. This tells us that your target audience is almost certainly found among those numbers.
- Recent reports show that roughly 70% of adults in the U.S. are Facebook users. According to industry data, over 60% of smartphone users in the U.S. are active on Instagram.
- Speaking of Facebook, 75% of "business-to-consumer" marketers have found customers because of that platform.
- What's more, an astounding 92% of people ages 18–29 are social media users, 85% of those aged 30-49, an impressive 78% of those aged 50–64, and still a significant 52% of those aged 65 and older.
