## What Is a Small Business Website and Why Should You Care?

Whether you're a small business owner looking to build a website yourself or just diving into the basics of getting your business online, getting clear on terminology is crucial. It helps you make informed decisions, communicate effectively with freelancers or agencies when you are ready to hand off your website to someone else, and ensures you understand the key components of your website.

A website, in a simple concept, means a connection to your clients without you having to interact personally with them. It allows your business to be available 24/7, providing information, answering questions, and even generating sales, all without requiring you to be there in person.

In other words, it’s a 24/7 salesman that works tirelessly to attract and inform potential customers, making your business accessible anytime without requiring your presence.

Some implications of having a small business website for your business are:

- **Personal Benefit**: It allows you, as a business owner, to save time by providing answers and resources to potential customers without your constant involvement. This gives you more freedom to focus on other parts of your business or personal life.
- **Business Benefit**: A website acts as a 24/7 salesperson, driving traffic, generating leads, and providing credibility to your small business. It also enables targeted digital marketing efforts, such as SEO and advertising, to be more effective.
- **Societal Benefit**: By making your services easily accessible online, you contribute to better customer experiences. Customers can access information, book services, or make purchases at any time, which is convenient and empowering for them.

## History of Small Business Websites

The history of small business websites began in the early days of the internet, when only large corporations could afford to create and maintain an online presence. As technology advanced and website-building platforms became more user-friendly and affordable, small businesses started realizing the importance of having an online presence. Today, having a website is almost a necessity for small businesses to stay competitive and connect with their customers effectively.

A side effect of this history is that small businesses now have access to tools and platforms that make building and managing a website more feasible than ever, even without technical skills. This evolution has leveled the playing field, allowing small business owners to compete with larger companies by providing value and accessibility through their websites.

If you want more than just the Cliff Notes version: I learned most of this history of small business websites from [Moz's Guide to Small Business Websites](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-small-business-websites).

### Step 5. Add Essential Pages

Create the essential pages for your business, including Home, About, Services, and Contact. The more valuable pages you add that address common questions and topics people are searching for, the better you address your clients' needs and improve your SEO.

Why is it important? These pages provide the information your visitors need to make decisions.

Why is it important? SEO helps your website get found by people searching for your services.

### Step 7. Publish and Promote

Once everything is set up, publish your website and start promoting it through social media, email marketing, and local advertising.
