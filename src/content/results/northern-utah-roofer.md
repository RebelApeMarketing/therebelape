    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      A residential roofing contractor in Northern Utah was doing solid work and getting referrals, but growth was inconsistent. Some months were great. Some were slow. The business depended on word-of-mouth and door-to-door canvassing, which meant they couldn't control lead flow or predict revenue.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Their online presence existed but wasn't working. The website got some traffic but wasn't optimized for conversions. They showed up in Google Maps but weren't dominating local search. They had no system for generating leads on demand—just hoping the phone would ring.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6 border-b-4 border-rebel-green pb-3">The Solution</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We built a multi-channel lead generation system that generates calls from multiple sources instead of relying on a single tactic.
    </p>
    <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-rebel-green p-6 rounded-r-lg mb-8 shadow-xl">
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 font-semibold italic">
        Most contractors think in terms of individual services—"I need a website" or "I need Google Ads" or "I need SEO." But that's not how consistent lead generation works. You need a complete system where every channel feeds the others, compounds over time, and creates multiple paths for qualified homeowners to find you.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-rebel-green">The Foundation Phase</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">We started by building the infrastructure: conversion optimization, call tracking, and the technical foundation that makes everything else work. This isn't the sexy part, but you can't build a skyscraper on soft dirt. Month 1 is about creating a system that can scale, not chasing quick wins that fall apart.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-rebel-green">The Launch and Training Phase</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">We launched the full system and let it learn. Algorithms need data. Platforms need time to figure out what a qualified lead looks like for this specific business in this specific market. Early leads are expensive. Month 2 is uncomfortable. But the contractors who trust the process see it compound in months 3-6.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">As data came in, we optimized everything. What's working gets more budget. What's not working gets fixed or cut. This isn't "set it and forget it"—it's continuous testing, measuring, and improving based on real numbers.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">By months 6-8, the full system is firing. Multiple channels generating consistent leads. Rankings improving. Authority building. Brand searches increasing. Every channel making the others stronger. That's when you stop chasing leads and start managing lead flow.</p>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Predictable Lead Flow</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Instead of hoping for referrals or relying on door-to-door when crews have time, the contractor now has 70+ calls per month coming in consistently. They can plan crew schedules, forecast revenue, and make business decisions based on actual lead volume instead of guesses.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Multi-Channel Resilience</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">When one channel has a slow week, others pick up the slack. The system generates leads from multiple sources simultaneously. If paid ads have an off day, organic search picks it up. If website traffic dips, other channels compensate. The system compounds instead of depending on a single source.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">High-Intent Leads</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">The 69% close rate proves these aren't just tire-kickers—they're qualified homeowners ready to buy. Quality over volume. Every lead costs money, so every lead needs to convert. This system targets people actively searching for roofing services, not cold prospects who might need a roof someday.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Scalable System</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">As budget allows, this system scales. More investment generates more leads. More content improves rankings. More authority strengthens every channel. Everything works together to build a lead generation machine that compounds over time rather than starting from zero every month.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Lead generation systems need time to learn. Early performance is inconsistent and expensive. But as the system gathers data and figures out what a qualified lead looks like for your specific business, performance improves dramatically. Contractors who trust the process and stick it out see results compound in months 3-6.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Relying on one lead source is risky. If that channel has a bad month, your business suffers. Multiple channels mean consistent lead flow regardless of seasonality, algorithm changes, or market fluctuations. Some months paid channels dominate. Some months organic search converts better. The system balances itself.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">The 69% close rate proves we're not just generating call volume—we're generating qualified homeowners with real roofing needs, ready to buy. That's what happens when you target the right searches, optimize for conversion, and build trust before they ever pick up the phone.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">The 60% year-over-year traffic increase didn't happen overnight. Building online authority is a marathon, not a sprint. But as visibility improves, content gets indexed, and authority builds, traffic compounds. That traffic converts into high-ticket projects over time and costs nothing per click.</p>
