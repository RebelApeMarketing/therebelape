    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      In 2018, a small wedding chapel just off the Las Vegas Strip faced a brutal reality: in one of the most competitive wedding markets in the world, they were invisible online.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Las Vegas has hundreds of wedding chapels. Every major hotel offers wedding packages. Big-name chapels with massive marketing budgets dominate search results. Tourists searching for Vegas weddings see the same established players over and over. Breaking into that market as a smaller chapel means competing against corporations with unlimited budgets and decades of brand recognition.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The chapel offered Elvis weddings, traditional ceremonies, and vow renewals. They had a great location just off the Strip. They delivered excellent service. But none of that mattered if couples planning Vegas weddings couldn't find them online.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      They needed visibility in a market where everyone is fighting for the same searches—"Vegas wedding chapel," "Elvis wedding Las Vegas," "get married in Vegas." Without online presence, they were leaving thousands of potential bookings on the table while tourists booked with whoever showed up first in Google.

    <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6 border-b-4 border-rebel-green pb-3">The Solution</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We built a comprehensive lead generation system designed to compete in Las Vegas's brutal wedding chapel market.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Vegas wedding searches are expensive. Competition is fierce. Ranking organically takes time and consistent execution. We needed a system that could generate bookings immediately while building the long-term SEO authority required to dominate local search.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We launched with a conversion-focused website showcasing their ceremony options, particularly their Elvis weddings and traditional services. Clear pricing. Easy booking process. Mobile-optimized for tourists planning weddings on their phones. High-quality photos showing the chapel and ceremony options.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Set up comprehensive call tracking, conversion optimization, and analytics infrastructure. Built Google Business Profile presence and started aggressive review generation. Created content targeting every type of Vegas wedding search: Elvis weddings, vow renewals, traditional ceremonies, elopements.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Launched paid advertising to generate immediate bookings while organic rankings built. As rankings improved, ad costs dropped because brand searches increased. More reviews came in. More service pages got indexed. The chapel started showing up for dozens of wedding-related searches across the Vegas market.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We expanded content strategy to cover every ceremony type, every search variation, and every tourist question about getting married in Vegas. Built out service pages for Elvis weddings, vow renewals, LGBT weddings, and traditional ceremonies. The goal: own wedding chapel search in Vegas.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The system evolved with their business. As the chapel grew and renovated, we updated the website and marketing materials. As new ceremony types were added, we created new service pages and targeted new searches. Eight years later, they're still with us because the system continues generating bookings year after year.

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Market Leadership in Vegas</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Going from a small chapel to one of the largest in Las Vegas doesn't happen by accident. It requires consistent online visibility, thousands of website visitors, and systematic lead generation that works year after year.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Predictable Bookings Year-Round</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Wedding chapels in Vegas deal with seasonal fluctuations. A systematic lead generation machine smooths out those peaks and valleys. Consistent website traffic. Consistent calls. Consistent bookings.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Multi-Year SEO Authority</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Rankings that took years to achieve now generate hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. Content created years ago still ranks and brings in couples planning weddings today.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Partnership Built on Results</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Eight years is a long time in marketing. A partnership that lasts eight years means the system adapts as the business grows. New ceremony types get marketed. New search trends get targeted.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Eight years. In Las Vegas. In the wedding industry. That's how long this client has been with us. Wedding chapels in one of the most competitive markets in the world don't stay with agencies that long unless the system delivers.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Competing in Brutal Markets Requires Complete Systems</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Las Vegas wedding chapel marketing isn't for amateurs. You're competing against major brands with unlimited budgets. You need paid advertising for immediate bookings. You need SEO for long-term authority. Random tactics don't work. Complete systems do.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Authority Building Takes Years But Lasts Forever</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">The 240,000 annual visitors and #1 rankings this chapel has today weren't built in 90 days. They were built over eight years of consistent content creation, link building, review generation, and technical optimization. But rankings achieved years ago still generate traffic today.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Tourist Markets Need Constant Online Visibility</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Wedding chapels in Vegas aren't selling to locals who might refer friends. They're selling to tourists who search Google once, book once, and never come back. Every couple is a new customer. That means you need to show up in search results every single day.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Going from small chapel to market leader doesn't happen in six months. It requires years of systematic execution. Building authority that compounds. Accumulating reviews that build trust. A marketing system that lasts eight years isn't about quick wins—it's about building something that generates predictable results year after year.</p>
