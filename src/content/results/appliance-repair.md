    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      In 2018, a new appliance repair company launched in Northern Utah with one massive problem: nobody knew they existed.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Zero online presence. Zero authority. Zero reputation in a market already crowded with established competitors who'd been around for decades. They couldn't rely on word-of-mouth because they didn't have any history yet. They couldn't depend on referrals because they hadn't built a customer base.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Starting a service business from scratch means you need leads immediately, not six months from now. But you're competing against companies that dominate Google search results, have hundreds of reviews, and own the top positions for every service-related search term in your market.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The owner needed a marketing system that could generate leads from day one—while simultaneously building the long-term authority required to compete with established players. Quick wins to keep the business alive. Long-term strategy to build sustainable growth.

    <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6 border-b-4 border-rebel-green pb-3">The Solution</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We built a complete lead generation system designed for both immediate results and long-term compound growth.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Most startups make one of two mistakes: they chase quick wins that don't build authority, or they focus on long-term SEO while burning through cash waiting for results. We did both simultaneously. Paid channels generated leads immediately while organic strategies built authority that compounds over time.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We launched with a conversion-focused website built specifically for appliance repair services. Clear calls-to-action. Mobile-optimized for homeowners searching on their phones. Service pages targeting every appliance type they repair. Simultaneously launched paid advertising to generate calls while the organic strategy ramped up.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Set up call tracking, conversion optimization, and reporting infrastructure. Built Google Business Profile presence and started review generation system. Created content targeting appliance-specific searches in their service area.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      As organic rankings improved, paid ad costs dropped because brand searches increased. More reviews came in. More service pages got indexed. More local visibility across dozens of appliance repair search terms. The system started feeding itself—every lead generated more authority, which generated more organic visibility, which reduced reliance on paid ads.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We expanded content strategy, optimized for local search across multiple cities, and built out service-specific landing pages for each appliance type and location combination. The goal: own every relevant search in their service area.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The marketing evolved as their business evolved. New services got added. New locations got targeted. The system scaled with their growth. Eight years later, they're still with us because the system actually works.

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">From Invisible to Market Leader</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">In 2018, nobody knew this company existed. Eight years later, they're one of the largest appliance repair companies in Northern Utah. That transformation doesn't happen by accident—it happens through consistent execution and a marketing system that compounds over time.</p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Predictable Lead Flow at Scale</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Thousands of calls per year coming in consistently. Not hoping for referrals. Not depending on word-of-mouth. A systematic lead generation machine that feeds the business day after day, year after year.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Multi-Year Authority Building</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Rankings that took years to achieve now generate traffic that costs nothing per click. Reviews accumulated over eight years build trust before prospects ever call. Brand recognition means higher close rates and better customers.</p>
      </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-rebel-green mb-3">Partnership That Evolves</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Marketing isn't "set it and forget it." An eight-year partnership means the system evolves as the business evolves. New services get marketed. New locations get targeted. The strategy adapts while the core system continues generating leads.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Eight years. That's how long this client has been with us. Contractors don't stay with agencies that long unless the system actually delivers. They stay because the phone keeps ringing, the leads keep converting, and the business keeps growing.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">New businesses can't afford to wait six months for SEO results. But they also can't survive on paid ads alone without building long-term authority. The solution: run both simultaneously. Paid channels generate immediate leads while organic strategies build authority that compounds over time.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">The traffic and rankings this company has today weren't built in 90 days. They were built over eight years of consistent execution. Content created years ago still ranks and generates leads today. Reviews accumulated over time build trust that converts prospects.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">What worked in year one doesn't work the same way in year eight. Markets change. Competition changes. A marketing system that lasts eight years isn't static—it adapts, evolves, and scales as the business grows. That's the difference between a vendor and a partner.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Going from zero to one of the largest companies in your market requires systematic execution over years. It requires a complete marketing system, not random tactics. And it requires a partner who's committed to long-term growth, not just short-term wins.</p>
