## The Problem

A mental health care franchise specializing in brain-based wellness was struggling to generate consistent leads. Their existing website wasn't converting visitors, and they had no paid advertising strategy in place.

They needed a system that would:
- Generate qualified leads consistently
- Reach people actively searching for mental health solutions
- Convert website visitors into booked consultations
- Track and measure results accurately

## The Solution

We built a complete lead generation system from the ground up:

### Landing Page Optimization
- Created conversion-focused landing pages designed specifically for paid traffic
- Implemented clear calls-to-action and trust-building elements
- Optimized page speed and mobile experience
- Added social proof and testimonials

### Google Ads Strategy
- Launched targeted search campaigns focusing on high-intent keywords
- Created ad copy that spoke directly to pain points
- Implemented conversion tracking and call tracking
- Continuously optimized based on performance data

### Conversion Rate Optimization
- A/B tested different headlines and CTAs
- Streamlined the contact form process
- Added live chat functionality
- Implemented retargeting campaigns

## The Results

Within 90 days, the franchise was generating:

- **60+ qualified leads per month** from paid advertising
- **45% conversion rate** on landing pages (industry average is 10-15%)
- **3.2x return** on ad spend
- **Consistent pipeline** of potential clients

## The Impact

The predictable lead flow allowed them to:
- Hire additional staff to handle increased consultations
- Expand their service offerings
- Plan for growth with confidence
- Focus on client care instead of worrying about lead generation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Targeted Traffic Works**: Focusing on high-intent search terms brought qualified prospects
2. **Landing Pages Matter**: A dedicated, optimized landing page converted 3x better than the homepage
3. **Testing Drives Results**: Continuous A/B testing improved conversion rates by 22% over 3 months
4. **Tracking Enables Optimization**: Proper conversion tracking allowed us to double down on what worked
