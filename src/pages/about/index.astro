              We've been in this space long enough to see the pattern. Agencies hide behind inflated numbers. They take credit for sales they didn't make. They optimize for metrics that sound good in a report—<strong>not metrics that actually grow your business.</strong>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              At Rebel Ape Marketing, we focus on one thing: <strong>lead generation.</strong> Specifically, we build and refine the channels that actually work for home service companies. Websites. Landing pages. Paid ads. That's it.

          Our Story: From Full Service to <span class="text-rebel-green">Laser Focus</span>
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
          <p>
            A few years back, I partnered with someone and we grew XYZ Marketing (yes, that was the name) quickly. We had great clients—many are still with us today. But we learned a hard lesson: <strong>full-service means stretched thin.</strong> Everyone running in a million directions. No focus. No real impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            When my business partner left to start something new, I took the win: I absorbed what worked from XYZ Marketing and killed everything else. We dove deep into the analytics of hundreds of campaigns and asked one question: <strong>What actually matters?</strong>
          </p>
          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl overflow-hidden">
            <div class="h-1 bg-rebel-green"></div>
            <div class="p-6">
              <p class="text-xl text-gray-900 mb-0">
                The answer was humbling. <strong>Almost nothing.</strong> And as AI reshaped the landscape, even fewer things mattered.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">
            So we doubled down. We stopped offering everything. We started offering only what works.

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Leads don't close themselves. When we deliver leads, many of them get lost in your sales process. So we help you identify the holes—in your follow-up, your nurturing, your sales, your post-sale. We help you fix those.
