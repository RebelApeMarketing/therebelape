            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              I've been building things on the internet since 2000. Started with graphic design, moved into website development around 2010, and by 2018 I was the guy getting pulled into every strategy meeting because I'd become so absorbed in how marketing actually works that I couldn't just design and develop anymore—I had to understand <strong>why certain things converted and others didn't.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              That's when I went all-in on marketing. And specifically, <strong>contractor and home services marketing.</strong> My oldest contractor client has been with me since 2018—an appliance repair company that's stayed because we keep their phone ringing, not because they're locked into some bullshit contract.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              I've worked with more contractors than any other industry, and more roofing companies than any other vertical in home services. This isn't a side focus—it's <strong>the focus.</strong>

          Why <span class="text-rebel-green">Rebel Ape</span> Exists
        </h2>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-center">
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            The name came from a moment of pure frustration.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            I was working for an agency that embodied everything wrong with this industry. One day, the owner looked at a contractor's website we were building and said, <strong>"Look, I don't care what the site looks like or if it even works. I want it live so we can start billing this guy."</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            I told him I felt like a monkey behind a keyboard.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl overflow-hidden mb-6">
            <div class="h-1 bg-rebel-green"></div>
            <div class="p-6">
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-0">
                So I took the files home that night, worked until I had something I was actually proud of, brought it back the next morning, and published a site that worked. <strong>A little rebellion. A lot of principle.</strong>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            That's where Rebel Ape came from. I got tired of the churn-and-burn mentality. Tired of agencies that treated contractors like account numbers. Tired of watching good business owners get burned by people who didn't actually care if the marketing worked.

            Most of our clients stay for years. Our longest clients have been with us since 2018—<strong>without contracts, without guarantees</strong> that sound impressive but mean nothing when it's time to deliver. They stay because we keep the phone ringing.

            We don't lock you in because we're confident. If we're not getting you results, fire us. Not because you're hoping for free work (nobody actually gives it) or waiting for some massive check they'll never write (I've seen that playbook before).

                That means we own the outcome. If leads aren't coming in, we don't shrug and say "that's marketing." We fix it.

                I started Rebel Ape because I wanted to work with contractors who take their businesses seriously, and I wanted to be the kind of marketing partner I'd want if I were in their shoes.
