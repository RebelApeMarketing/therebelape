    <!-- Why Local Marketing Matters -->

        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">Why Local Marketing Matters for Contractors</h2>
          <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p class="mb-4">
              When homeowners need a roofer, plumber, or HVAC technician, they search for someone nearby. They're not looking for a company three states away — they want a contractor who knows their area, understands local building codes, and can show up when they need help. That's why local marketing isn't optional for home service businesses. It's essential.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              We specialize in helping contractors dominate their local markets. Whether you're trying to rank higher in Google Maps, show up in "near me" searches, or get more calls from people in your service area, we build marketing systems designed specifically for your geography. Our approach combines local SEO, targeted Google Ads, and high-converting websites that turn visitors into booked jobs.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Every market is different. What works in Salt Lake City won't necessarily work in Las Vegas. Competition levels vary. Search behavior changes. That's why we tailor our strategies to each location we serve. We research the local landscape, identify opportunities your competitors are missing, and build campaigns that put you in front of the right customers at the right time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our clients see measurable results: more phone calls, more booked estimates, and more revenue from customers in their target areas. If you're ready to own your local market, select your state above and see how we can help contractors in your area grow their business.
