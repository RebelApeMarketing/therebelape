  {
    question: "How long does it take to rank in the Map Pack?",
    answer: "Depends on competition and your starting point. If your profile is currently a mess, we see movement within 2-4 weeks. If you're competing in a saturated market, it can take 2-3 months to break into the top 3. The key is consistent optimization—most competitors abandon their profiles after initial setup, so staying active gives you an edge."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you guarantee Map Pack rankings?",
    answer: "No, and anyone who guarantees rankings is full of shit. Google's algorithm changes constantly, and local pack rankings depend on dozens of factors (some outside our control). What we can guarantee: we'll optimize every element, stay active with posts and photos, manage reviews properly, and give you the best possible shot at ranking. Most of our clients see significant improvement within 90 days."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I really need to post every week?",
    answer: "You don't need to, but it helps significantly. Google rewards active profiles. Weekly posts signal that you're a real, active business. It's not the #1 ranking factor, but it's an easy win that most competitors ignore. We handle it for you, so it doesn't add work to your plate."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I get a bad review?",
    answer: "We respond to every review—good and bad. A professional response to a negative review actually builds more trust than having zero bad reviews (which looks fake). We help you handle negative feedback constructively and get more positive reviews to bury the occasional bad one. Reviews are part of the game; how you handle them is what matters."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just SEO?",
    answer: "No. GBP optimization overlaps with local SEO, but it's specifically focused on your Google Business Profile. SEO is broader—website optimization, content creation, technical fixes, etc. GBP is the Map Pack, your profile features, reviews, and posts. They work together, but they're different services."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do this myself?",
    answer: "Sure. Just like you could do your own bookkeeping. But do you have time to post weekly, respond to reviews, upload photos, monitor Q&A, adjust categories, track performance, and stay on top of algorithm changes? We handle all of it so you can focus on running jobs and closing deals."

              Here's what usually happens: contractor creates a Google Business Profile, adds their business name and address, maybe uploads one photo, and never touches it again. Then they wonder why competitors show up in the Map Pack and they don't.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Your GBP isn't a one-time setup. It's an ongoing lead generation machine—if you actually use it. Weekly posts signal activity to Google. Fresh photos show you're legitimate. Review responses build trust. Proper categories and service areas determine if you even show up in relevant searches.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Most contractors are leaving their second-biggest lead source completely untapped. We don't let that happen.

            Most agencies "optimize" your GBP once and charge you a monthly fee to do nothing. We treat it like what it is—a lead generation channel that needs consistent attention. Every week, we're posting updates. Every month, we're adding fresh photos. Every review gets a response. Every new service or area gets added immediately. Your profile stays active, relevant, and optimized for exactly what customers are searching for.

              Why GBP Works Best <span class="text-rebel-green">With Your Full System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Your Google Business Profile doesn't work in isolation. When it's optimized alongside your website and ads, everything amplifies. People see your ad, check your GBP for reviews, and land on your website ready to call. Or they search organically, see you in the Map Pack, and call directly from your profile.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              When all three work together—website converting, ads driving traffic, GBP building trust—you're not dependent on any single channel. You dominate local search from every angle.

                <p class="text-gray-700">When your website and GBP both rank, you own more real estate on page 1. Searchers see your business multiple times, building recognition and trust. Your website converts the click, your GBP builds the credibility.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Running ads without an optimized GBP is leaving money on the table. People click your ad, then check your reviews before calling. If your profile looks neglected, they bounce. If it's dialed in, they convert.</p>
