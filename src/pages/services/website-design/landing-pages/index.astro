  {
    question: "Why can't I just use my homepage for ads?",
    answer: "Your homepage is built for education and navigation\u2014showing all your services, giving visitors multiple paths to explore. That's great for organic traffic. But when someone clicks your ad with specific intent and lands on a homepage with twelve different CTAs, they get confused and bounce. A landing page removes all distractions and focuses on one goal: get them to call you. Better focus = better conversion rates."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a landing page and a service page?",
    answer: "Service pages are educational\u2014they explain what you do, how it works, why it matters. Landing pages are conversion-focused\u2014they assume the visitor is already interested (they clicked your ad) and push them toward one action. Service pages have navigation and multiple CTAs. Landing pages strip away distractions."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a landing page?",
    answer: "Typically 1-2 weeks. If it's part of a Google Ads campaign setup, it's built during Month 1 alongside the ad campaign. Standalone projects can turn around faster\u2014sometimes as quick as a week if content and approvals move fast."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build multiple landing pages for different campaigns?",
    answer: "Absolutely. If you're running ads for emergency services, new construction, and residential repairs, each should have its own landing page with messaging that matches the ad. Better message match = better conversion rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you write the landing page copy or do I?",
    answer: "We write it. Landing page copy is different from website copy\u2014shorter, more direct, conversion-focused. We research your market, understand the campaign goal, and write copy designed to convert. You review and approve before it goes live."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you track conversions?",
    answer: "We set up conversion tracking so you know exactly how many calls and form submissions the landing page generates. If you have a CRM, we integrate it so leads flow directly into your system. We also track user behavior\u2014scroll depth, button clicks, form interactions\u2014so we can optimize based on real data."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my landing page isn't converting well?",
    answer: "That's where A/B testing comes in. We test different headlines, CTAs, button colors, form lengths\u2014whatever might be holding back conversions. We monitor performance and optimize continuously until conversion rates improve. If the landing page is part of ongoing ads management, this optimization is included."

              Your homepage is built for education and navigation&mdash;showing all your services, telling your story, building trust over time. That's great for organic traffic. But when someone clicks your ad looking for emergency roof repair and lands on a page with twelve different CTAs, they bounce. A landing page is different. One specific goal: convert the visitor who just clicked your paid ad. No navigation pulling them away. Just a focused message that matches the ad, a clear call-to-action, and nothing else getting in the way.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              If your ad click-through rate is good but your conversion rate sucks, your landing page is the problem. When you're paying $30-80 per click, you can't afford to send traffic to a page that wasn't built to convert.
