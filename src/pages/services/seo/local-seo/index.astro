    question: "How long does it take to see results from Local SEO?",
    answer: "Realistically, 6-8 months to see meaningful results. Month 1 is foundation\u2014Google Business Profile optimization, on-page fixes, citations, and technical setup. Months 2-3, you start seeing early movement in rankings. Months 4-6, Map Pack visibility improves and organic traffic increases. Months 6-8+, everything compounds\u2014rankings solidify, organic leads flow consistently, and your authority builds. Contractors who quit in month 3 never see the compounding that happens after the foundation is built. That's why we pair SEO with Google Ads\u2014ads get leads flowing now while SEO builds long-term."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is Local SEO so expensive if it takes so long?",
    answer: "Because you're building an asset, not renting visibility. Google Ads stops when you pause the budget. Local SEO keeps working. Every month you invest compounds\u2014better rankings, more Map Pack visibility, increased authority. Over time, SEO becomes your most cost-effective lead source because organic leads cost nothing beyond the monthly maintenance. The upfront investment is higher, but the long-term ROI is significantly better than paying for clicks indefinitely."
  },
  {
    question: "Why didn't SEO work for me before?",
    answer: "Usually one of three reasons: (1) You quit before it had time to work (6-8 months is realistic, not 30 days), (2) The agency was a content farm pumping out generic posts with no brand voice or strategy, or (3) They focused only on rankings without optimizing for conversions\u2014traffic that doesn't convert is worthless. We fix all three by setting realistic timelines, creating brand-voice content, and optimizing for leads, not just rankings."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I just do SEO without paying for ads?",
    answer: "You can, but it's risky. SEO takes 6-8 months minimum. If you're relying only on SEO, you're waiting 6-8 months before leads start flowing consistently. Most contractors can't afford that. Running Google Ads alongside SEO means you get leads now while building the long-term authority. Once SEO kicks in, you can scale back ad spend as organic leads increase. It's the safest, most predictable approach."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Local SEO and regular SEO?",
    answer: "Local SEO focuses on showing up in your service area for location-based searches (\"roofer near me,\" \"plumber in [city]\"). It emphasizes Google Business Profile optimization, Map Pack rankings, local citations, and geo-targeted content. Regular SEO focuses on broader keyword rankings and national visibility. For contractors, Local SEO is what matters\u2014you serve specific areas, not the entire country."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?",
    answer: "AEO is optimizing your content to show up in AI-powered search tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google's AI Overviews, and voice assistants. As search evolves beyond traditional Google results, AEO ensures your business is the answer when AI tools respond to user queries. We build content that feeds both traditional search engines and AI platforms, so you're visible wherever customers are searching."

              SEO takes 6-8 months to really kick in. It's not instant like Google Ads. But once it starts working, it doesn't stop. Every month builds on the last&mdash;your rankings improve, Map Pack visibility increases, and your authority grows. Unlike paid ads that disappear when you pause them, SEO keeps working even when you're not actively spending.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Most agencies pump out generic blog posts with no brand voice and promise "page 1 in 30 days." That's not how it works. Local SEO is a 6-8 month investment&mdash;foundation first, then compounding growth. Contractors who quit in month 3 never see the results that happen in months 6, 9, and 12. That's why we pair Local SEO with Google Ads&mdash;ads get leads now while SEO builds long-term authority.

            Most contractors who "tried SEO" either got burned by a content farm or quit before it had time to work. The problem isn't SEO&mdash;it's agencies that overpromise, underdeliver, and churn out generic content with no brand voice. We build Local SEO around three pillars: Google Business Profile optimization for Map Pack visibility, on-page optimization and content for organic rankings, and citations/schema for authority signals.
