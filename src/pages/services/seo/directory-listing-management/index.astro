  {
    question: "What is directory listing management?",
    answer: "Directory listing management ensures your business information (name, address, phone number) is accurate and consistent across all major online directories like Google, Bing, Yelp, Apple Maps, and industry-specific platforms. Inconsistent or outdated listings confuse search engines and cost you rankings."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do directory listings matter for SEO?",
    answer: "Search engines use directory listings (citations) as trust signals. The more consistent and accurate your business information is across the web, the more confident Google is in showing your business in search results and the Map Pack. Inconsistent NAP data is one of the most common reasons contractors struggle with local rankings."
  },
  {
    question: "How many directories do you manage?",
    answer: "We manage listings across all major directories including Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Apple Maps, Yelp, Facebook, and dozens of industry-specific and local directories. The exact number depends on your industry and service area, but we typically manage 50+ listings per client."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my listings are inconsistent?",
    answer: "Inconsistent listings (different phone numbers, old addresses, misspelled business names) confuse search engines and reduce your local rankings. They also confuse potential customers who may call the wrong number or show up at the wrong address. We audit and fix all inconsistencies as part of our management service."
