    question: "What kind of content do you write?",
    answer: "We write blog posts, service pages, location pages, and FAQ content specifically for contractors. Everything is built around your brand voice and positioning—not generic keyword-stuffed articles that read like they were written by a content farm."
  },
  {
    question: "How is your content different from other SEO agencies?",
    answer: "Most agencies churn out generic, AI-generated content with no brand voice. We write content that sounds like your company, addresses real customer questions, and is optimized for both traditional search engines and AI-powered answer engines (AEO). Every piece is human-guided and built around your positioning."
  },
  {
    question: "How often do you publish content?",
    answer: "Publishing frequency depends on your plan and goals. Most clients get 2-4 pieces of content per month—a mix of blog posts, service pages, and location pages. Consistency matters more than volume. We'd rather publish 2 great pieces per month than 8 mediocre ones."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?",
    answer: "AEO is optimizing your content to show up in AI-powered search tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google's AI Overviews, and voice assistants. As search evolves beyond traditional Google results, AEO ensures your business is the answer when AI tools respond to user queries. We build content that feeds both traditional search engines and AI platforms."
