  {
    question: "How long does SEO actually take?",
    answer: "Real talk: 6-8 months minimum before you see serious results. Anyone promising top rankings in 30 days is either using black hat tactics that'll get you penalized, or they're full of shit. SEO is a marathon. Month 3 shows early movement. Month 6 shows real traction. Month 12 shows compound growth. That's why we usually pair it with ads—you need leads now, not in 8 months."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do SEO without running ads?",
    answer: "Absolutely. If you've got lead flow handled through referrals or other marketing, we can do SEO standalone. Just know the timeline—it's not going to solve an immediate lead problem. But if you're playing the long game and want to build lasting authority in your market, SEO-only works."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is your SEO different from other agencies?",
    answer: "Most agencies pump out AI-generated content that sounds like everyone else, chase quick rankings with sketchy tactics, or promise results they can't deliver. We build actual authority. Human-driven strategy. Content that positions you as the expert. Optimized for traditional search and answer engines. We tell you the truth about timelines instead of making guru promises."
  },
  {
    question: "What about Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?",
    answer: "It's the evolution of SEO. Google's AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity—they're all pulling from somewhere. We optimize your content so you show up in those AI-generated answers, not just traditional search results. That's authority building for where search is going, not where it's been."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need SEO if I'm running ads?",
    answer: "Need? No. Should you? Yes. Ads get you leads now. SEO builds authority that compounds over time. When both work together, your cost per lead drops (better quality scores), your brand recognition increases, and you're not dependent on one channel. Plus, organic traffic doesn't stop when you pause ad spend."

              Here's the truth: SEO takes time. Real, legitimate, Google-won't-penalize-you SEO takes 6-8 months before you see serious momentum. Anyone promising #1 rankings in 30 days is either lying or using tactics that'll get you buried when Google catches on.

              But here's what most agencies miss: you're not just trying to rank a website. You're building authority in your market. You're positioning yourself as the expert. You're creating the kind of presence that shows up in Google search, Google AI overviews, and every answer engine that's coming next.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              That authority compounds. Month 12 is better than month 6. Year 2 is better than year 1. And unlike paid ads that stop the second you stop paying, your authority keeps working.

            Most agencies treat SEO like a checklist. Stuff keywords in pages. Build some backlinks. Call it done. That's why their clients see rankings bounce around and never really dominate. We build authority systematically. Every piece works together—local presence, technical foundation, content positioning, and strategic link building. It's not fast. But it's permanent.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              SEO takes 6-8+ months to really kick in. Most contractors can't wait that long for leads. That's why we typically bundle SEO with Google Ads—ads get you leads now, SEO builds the authority that compounds over time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              But here's the thing: you can absolutely do SEO as a standalone service. If you've got lead flow handled through referrals or existing marketing, and you just want to build long-term authority, we can do that. We just want you to know the timeline upfront.

                <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-lg mb-2">The Immediate + Long-Term Play</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Google Ads launch month 2 and start generating leads. SEO builds in the background. By month 8-12, your organic traffic is flowing and your cost per lead from ads drops because your quality score improved. That's the compound effect.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#32C55F] shadow-2xl">
                <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-lg mb-2">SEO-Only Works (If You Can Wait)</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Got your lead flow handled for now? Want to invest in long-term authority without running ads? We can do SEO standalone. Just know it's a 6-8 month minimum commitment before you see real momentum.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#32C55F] shadow-2xl">
                <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900 text-lg mb-2">Best of Both Worlds</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">When ads handle immediate leads and SEO builds long-term authority, you're not dependent on either one. Ads get more efficient as your organic presence grows. Organic keeps leads flowing even when you scale ads back.</p>
