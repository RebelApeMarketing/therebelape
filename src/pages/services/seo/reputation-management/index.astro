  {
    question: "Why do online reviews matter so much?",
    answer: "Reviews are one of the top ranking factors for the Google Map Pack. More importantly, they're the first thing potential customers look at before calling. A contractor with 150 five-star reviews will get more calls than one with 12 reviews—even if the 12-review contractor ranks higher. Reviews build trust, improve rankings, and directly increase lead volume."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove negative reviews?",
    answer: "We can't remove legitimate negative reviews—Google doesn't allow that. What we can do is help you respond professionally, flag reviews that violate Google's policies for removal, and most importantly, generate enough positive reviews that the occasional negative one doesn't tank your rating. The best defense against bad reviews is a steady stream of great ones."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you help generate more reviews?",
    answer: "We set up review generation campaigns that make it easy for happy customers to leave reviews. This includes automated review request sequences, direct links to your Google review page, and strategies for asking at the right time. Most contractors don't have a review problem—they have a review asking problem."
  },
  {
    question: "What star rating do I need to be competitive?",
    answer: "For most contractor categories, you want to be at 4.5 stars or above with a healthy volume of reviews. But star rating alone isn't enough—review volume and recency matter too. A 5.0 rating with 8 reviews from 2 years ago is less compelling than a 4.7 with 200 reviews, many from the last few months."
