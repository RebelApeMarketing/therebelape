  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results from Google Ads?",
    answer: "Month 1 is setup and foundation—building landing pages, configuring campaigns, and setting up tracking. Leads can start flowing within 2-4 weeks, but the algorithm is still learning. Month 2 is when leads really start coming in, though cost per lead might be higher as Google optimizes. Month 3+ is when everything compounds—cost per lead drops, lead quality improves, and the system becomes predictable. Contractors who quit in month 2 never see the compounding results that happen after the learning phase."
  },
  {
    question: "What's a realistic budget for Google Ads?",
    answer: "We typically recommend $1,000-$2,000/month in ad spend for contractors, depending on your market and competition. That gives Google enough data to learn and optimize without burning through your budget too quickly. Lower budgets can work, but it takes longer for the algorithm to gather enough conversion data. Higher budgets accelerate learning and increase lead volume, but only if your capacity can handle it."
  },
  {
    question: "Why didn't Google Ads work for me before?",
    answer: "Usually one of three reasons: (1) You quit before the algorithm had time to learn (month 2 is rough, month 3+ is where it pays off), (2) You didn't have enough budget for Google to gather meaningful conversion data, or (3) Your landing page or website didn't convert, so you were paying for clicks that went nowhere. We fix all three by building dedicated landing pages, optimizing consistently, and giving the system time to work."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pause Google Ads if I get too busy?",
    answer: "Absolutely. You can pause campaigns anytime and restart when you're ready for more leads. Some contractors run ads seasonally or only when their schedule has openings. The downside: when you pause for extended periods, the algorithm has to relearn when you turn it back on. But if your calendar is full, pausing makes sense."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I still need LSA if I have Google Ads?",
    answer: "Yes. LSA and Google Ads attract different types of leads and occupy different sections of search results. LSA gives you premium placement with the Google Guaranteed badge and pay-per-lead pricing. Google Ads gives you volume control, messaging flexibility, and the ability to scale infinitely. Running both means you dominate the top section and control your lead flow from multiple angles."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm getting clicks but no conversions?",
    answer: "That's a landing page problem, not a Google Ads problem. If your website or landing page doesn't convert, all the traffic in the world won't help. That's why we build dedicated landing pages for every campaign—fast load times, clear calls-to-action, and messaging designed specifically to turn clicks into calls. We also track conversion rates religiously and optimize based on real user behavior."

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              When contractors think "Google Ads," they usually think "expensive clicks that don't convert." That's because most agencies set up campaigns, point them at a generic website, and wonder why nothing happens. Or they run ads for a couple weeks, don't see instant results, and declare it doesn't work.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Here's what they're missing: Google Ads gives you complete control over who sees your ads, what messaging they see, and where they land when they click. You control the budget down to the dollar. You control which services to promote and which to turn off. And when done right—with dedicated landing pages built specifically for conversion—Google Ads becomes your most predictable lead source.

                Ads go live and leads start flowing. Month 2 can be rough—Google's algorithm is still learning who clicks, who converts, and who's wasting your money. Cost per lead might be higher because Google hasn't optimized yet. Contractors who quit here never see what happens next.

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                This is where it gets good. Google's algorithm has enough data to know who converts. Cost per lead drops. Lead quality improves. The ones who stick with it see consistent, scalable lead flow that they can control and predict.
