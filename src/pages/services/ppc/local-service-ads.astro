  {
    question: "How long does it take to get approved for LSA?",
    answer: "If you have all your documents ready (license, insurance, business registration), approval usually takes 5-10 business days. The background check takes the longest—Google's thorough. If your paperwork is missing or incorrect, it takes longer. We've guided dozens of contractors through this, so we know exactly what Google needs and how to help you get approved fast."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the cost per lead?",
    answer: "It varies by service, location, and competition. Roofing might be $30-80 per lead. Plumbing emergency calls might be $20-50. HVAC could be $40-100. You set your weekly budget, and we help optimize to keep you visible without blowing through it. The key advantage: you only pay when someone actually contacts you, not for every click."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I turn off LSA if I get too busy?",
    answer: "Absolutely. You can pause your LSA campaigns anytime and restart them when you're ready for more leads. Some contractors run LSA seasonally or only when their schedule has openings. It's your budget and your call volume—we adjust based on your capacity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I still need Google Ads if I have LSA?",
    answer: "Yes. LSA is great for premium placement and pay-per-lead pricing, but Google Ads gives you way more control—targeting, messaging, landing pages, budget flexibility, and volume. LSA is limited by Google's categories and lead caps. Google Ads scales infinitely. Running both means you dominate the top section with LSA and control the volume/messaging with Google Ads."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my star rating really matter that much?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Your LSA ranking is heavily influenced by your review count and star rating. A 4.8-star rating with 100+ reviews will rank higher than a 3.5-star rating with 20 reviews. We help you get more legitimate reviews and respond professionally to feedback so your ranking stays competitive. Low ratings = buried in LSA results = wasted budget."
  },
  {
    question: "What if LSA doesn't work in my area?",
    answer: "LSA isn't available for all services in all areas yet. If it's not available for your service/location, we focus on the channels that are—Google Ads, SEO, and GBP optimization. If LSA is available but not generating quality leads in your market, we reallocate budget to what's actually working. We're not married to any single channel."

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Local Service Ads appear in the top section of Google search results. Not the Map Pack. Not regular Google Ads. The premium section. When someone searches "roofer near me" or "emergency plumber," LSAs are the first thing they see—with that green Google Guaranteed checkmark right next to your business name.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              And here's the kicker: you only pay when someone actually contacts you. Not when they click. Not when they browse. When they call or message—that's it. Many contractors either don't know LSA exists, or they tried to set it up themselves, got frustrated with the verification process, and gave up.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              That's where we come in. We guide you through the entire setup process, help you get Google Guaranteed approved, optimize your budget and placement, and make sure you're getting the visibility you're paying for.

              LSA isn't a replacement for Google Ads or SEO. It's another weapon in your arsenal. When you combine LSA with regular Google Ads and organic rankings, you dominate search from multiple angles.

The verification process is a pain—background checks, license verification, insurance documentation, category selection. We've guided dozens of contractors through this.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              LSA is powerful, but it's not a complete marketing strategy. It's one piece of the puzzle. When you combine LSA with regular Google Ads and organic SEO, you own search results from top to bottom.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              LSA gets you that premium placement with the Google Guaranteed badge. Google Ads gives you control over messaging and targeting. SEO builds long-term authority and compounds over time. Together, they create a system where you're not dependent on any single channel—and you dominate your market from every angle.

                <p class="text-gray-700">LSA shows up in the top section. Google Ads appear right below it. When you run both, you own multiple spots on page 1. Searchers see your business multiple times, building recognition and trust. Plus, LSA's pay-per-lead model protects your budget while Google Ads gives you volume control.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">When your LSA, Map Pack, and organic listings all rank, you own significant real estate on the first page. That kind of visibility builds massive trust. Customers see you everywhere and assume you're a dominant player in your market—because you are.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">LSA for premium placement and trust. Google Ads for volume and control. SEO for long-term authority. When all three work together, you're not gambling on one channel. You dominate search from multiple angles, and if one channel has an off day, the others carry the load.</p>
