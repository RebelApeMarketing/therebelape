  {
    question: "What is call tracking and why do I need it?",
    answer: "Call tracking assigns unique phone numbers to each marketing channel—Google Ads, SEO, Local Service Ads, your website—so you know exactly which channel generated each call. Without it, you're guessing where your leads come from. With it, you can see which channels are actually driving revenue and stop wasting money on what's not working."
  },
  {
    question: "Will call tracking change my business phone number?",
    answer: "No. Your real business number stays the same. Call tracking uses forwarding numbers that route to your existing line. Customers call the tracking number, it forwards to you instantly, and you answer like normal. The only difference is now you have data on where that call came from."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I listen to recorded calls?",
    answer: "Yes. Call recording is included so you can review calls for quality, train your team, and verify that leads are being handled properly. You can also use recordings to identify which types of calls convert into jobs—giving you insight into what's actually driving revenue, not just phone rings."
  },
  {
    question: "How does call tracking work with Google Ads?",
    answer: "Call tracking integrates directly with Google Ads to show you which keywords, ads, and campaigns are generating phone calls. This lets us optimize your ad spend based on actual calls and booked jobs—not just clicks. It's the difference between knowing someone clicked your ad and knowing they called and booked a $15,000 job."
