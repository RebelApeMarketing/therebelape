  {
    question: "Does email marketing actually work for contractors?",
    answer: "Yes—when it's done right. Email marketing isn't about spamming inboxes. It's about staying top of mind with past customers so they call you first next time, nurturing leads who aren't ready to book yet, and automating review requests after completed jobs. Most contractors leave money on the table by never following up with past customers."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of emails do you send?",
    answer: "We build campaigns around what actually drives revenue for contractors: post-job follow-ups and review requests, seasonal maintenance reminders, promotional offers for slow periods, lead nurture sequences for people who inquired but didn't book, and newsletters that keep your brand top of mind. Everything is automated so you don't have to think about it."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you build my email list?",
    answer: "We help you capture emails from your website visitors, past customers, and leads through forms, landing pages, and CRM integration. We don't buy email lists—that's spam and it doesn't work. A list of 500 past customers who know your work is worth more than 50,000 random emails."
  },
  {
    question: "Will people unsubscribe or mark my emails as spam?",
    answer: "Some will—that's normal and healthy. Unsubscribes keep your list clean. The key is sending relevant, valuable content at the right frequency. We don't blast daily emails. We send targeted campaigns to the right segments at the right time. A well-managed email list has open rates of 30-50% for contractors—far above the industry average."
