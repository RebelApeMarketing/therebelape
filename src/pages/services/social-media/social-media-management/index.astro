  {
    question: "Will social media generate leads for my business?",
    answer: "Not directly like Google Ads. Social media is about brand awareness and staying visible\u2014keeping you top of mind when potential customers are scrolling, not actively searching. It showcases your work, builds trust, and reinforces your reputation. But if you need leads flowing now, Google Ads is the answer. Social media supports that by keeping you visible between searches."
  },
  {
    question: "How many posts per week?",
    answer: "We post 3x per week across all platforms\u2014Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Google Business Profile. That's consistent enough to stay visible without overwhelming your audience. Some contractors want more, some want less. We adjust based on your goals and capacity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to provide content or photos?",
    answer: "If you have job photos or specific content you want posted, we'll use them. But you don't have to. We create custom graphics and copy for every post. If you send us photos from jobs, great\u2014we'll incorporate them. If not, we handle content creation so you're not responsible for feeding us material."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I review posts before they go live?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We send you a monthly content calendar for review and approval. You see exactly what's going live, when, and on which platforms. If something needs adjusting, we fix it before it posts. You're never surprised by what shows up on your pages."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you respond to comments or messages?",
    answer: "No. We handle posting and content creation, but we don't manage customer service interactions. Comments, messages, and reviews are yours to handle. If you want us to engage with comments, that's a separate conversation\u2014but most contractors prefer to handle customer communication themselves."
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms do you post on?",
    answer: "Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Google Business Profile. We manage all four. If you don't want to be active on a specific platform, we can skip it and focus on the ones that matter to your audience."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from running Facebook or Instagram ads?",
    answer: "Social media management is organic posting\u2014no ad spend, just consistent content on your pages. Facebook/Instagram ads are paid campaigns designed to generate leads. Totally different goals. If you want social ads for lead generation, that's a separate service under PPC management. Organic social media is about visibility, not direct lead flow."

              Social media isn't going to make your phone ring like Google Ads. It's not a direct lead generation channel for contractors. But it keeps you visible when potential customers are scrolling, showcases your work to their network, and builds trust with people who aren't ready to hire today but will be in 3-6 months.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
              Most contractors know they should post but never do. They're too busy running jobs, or they post once, get no immediate response, and quit. Social media works when it's consistent&mdash;3x per week, every week, showing up in feeds and building brand awareness over time. We handle the posting so you stay visible without thinking about it.
