  {
    question: "What kind of graphic design do you do for contractors?",
    answer: "We design everything a contractor needs to look professional: business cards, truck and van wraps, yard signs, door hangers, estimate templates, social media graphics, ad creatives, flyers, and digital assets. Everything is designed to match your brand identity so your marketing looks consistent and professional across every touchpoint."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you design truck wraps?",
    answer: "Yes. Truck wraps are one of the highest-ROI marketing investments a contractor can make—your trucks are mobile billboards driving through your service area every day. We design wraps that are clean, professional, and easy to read at a glance. We work with your wrap installer to ensure the design prints and installs correctly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a logo before ordering graphic design?",
    answer: "Ideally, yes. Your logo is the foundation of all your marketing materials. If you don't have a professional logo yet, we can start with logo design and then build your marketing materials around it. If you already have a logo you're happy with, we'll work with it to create cohesive materials."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can you turn around design projects?",
    answer: "Most single-piece projects (business card, yard sign, social media template) take 3-5 business days. Larger projects like truck wraps or multi-piece collateral packages take 1-2 weeks. Rush turnaround is available when you need it. We'll always give you a clear timeline upfront."
