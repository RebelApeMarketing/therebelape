  {
    question: "How long does the logo design process take?",
    answer: "Typically 2-4 weeks from our brand discovery meeting to final delivery. That depends on how quickly we move through revisions, but we don't rush it. A logo you'll use for the next decade is worth getting right."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like any of the concepts?",
    answer: "That's what the brand discovery meeting is for — we dig deep into what you want before we design anything. But if the initial concepts miss the mark, we go back to the drawing board. The revisions exist to dial it in. We're not done until you've got a logo that represents your business."
  },
  {
    question: "Can't I just use AI to generate a logo?",
    answer: "You can. But AI doesn't think about where your logo needs to work — embroidered on a hat, on a truck at highway speed, on a yard sign from across the street. It also doesn't know that three of your competitors used the same prompt. If you want something that actually functions as a brand asset across every application, you need a designer who thinks about those things."
  },
  {
    question: "Why not just use a cheap freelance marketplace?",
    answer: "Bargain marketplace designers sell templates with your name swapped in. You're not getting a custom logo — you're getting a version of something that's been sold to dozens of other businesses. And when you need modifications for a specific application, that designer is long gone."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I own the logo when it's done?",
    answer: "Yes. Full ownership and usage rights transfer to you upon final approval and payment. The logo is yours to use however and wherever you want."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have a logo but it needs updating?",
    answer: "We do logo refreshes too. Sometimes a business doesn't need a complete rebrand — they need their existing logo cleaned up, modernized, and made to work across all the formats and applications they need. We can talk about what makes sense for your situation."

            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Before a homeowner ever reads your reviews, visits your website, or hears your pitch — they see your logo. It's on the truck parked in their neighbor's driveway. It's on the yard sign they drive past. It's in the Google search results next to your competitors. And it either says "established professional" or "just some guy with a truck." Most contractors either don't have a real logo, or they have something they grabbed off the internet and changed the text on. That worked when they were starting out — but now they're bidding on bigger jobs, hiring crews, building a reputation, and their brand doesn't match where they're headed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Then there are the shortcuts that make it worse. AI-generated logos that look identical to three other roofers in your market because you all typed the same prompt. Cheap freelancer logos that are templates sold to 50 other businesses with different text swapped in. You think it's unique. It's not. And the "designer" disappeared the second you paid.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              The real cost isn't what you paid for a bad logo — it's every impression that logo makes while it's out there representing you. Every truck wrap, every business card, every yard sign telling potential customers this company doesn't take itself seriously enough to invest in how they look.

                Based on what we learn, we develop logo concepts built around your actual brand — not generic construction imagery slapped together. Every concept is designed to work across real-world applications: vehicle wraps, embroidery, signage, digital, print. If it doesn't work at every size and on every surface, it doesn't make the cut.

We walk you through each concept in a professional presentation — showing you the logo in multiple color variations, on different backgrounds, and in real-world mockup applications. We talk through what works, what represents your brand, and what needs adjustment. You get three rounds of revisions to dial it in.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              AI can generate a logo in seconds. It can even make it look decent on a screen. But it can't think about your business. It doesn't know that your logo needs to read clean embroidered on a dark polo. It doesn't know that fine detail lines disappear on a yard sign at 30 feet.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              It doesn't know that your competitor three towns over used the same prompt and now you look like his satellite office. AI generates images. It doesn't build brands.

              That $50 "custom" logo from a freelance marketplace? It's a template. The designer swapped your business name into a layout they've sold dozens of times. You don't own the concept — you own a version of it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              And when you need it modified for a truck wrap or scaled up for a banner, good luck finding the original designer. They've already moved on to the next $50 job.
