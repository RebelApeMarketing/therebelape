How Online Marketing Will Transform Your Business Growth Trajectory

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Online marketing</strong>&nbsp;is the key to changing the trajectory of your business for the better. The various components of&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;include email campaigns, content strategy, social media and search engine optimization (SEO).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The world of marketing has transformed many times over the past several decades. We've witnessed a significant shift from traditional marketing to digital marketing. The difference between the two is how the marketing is delivered to the potential customer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, traditional marketing relies heavily on printed materials, such as newspapers and magazines. In contrast,&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;relies more on internet-based mediums such as social media, websites, or apps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both types of marketing can be beneficial depending upon what the product or service is and what the business goals may be. In today's current environment,&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;is the direction most businesses are going to achieve their objectives. When properly implemented,&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;tactics will strengthen your business and make it more successful.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Essential Components of Online Marketing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Email Marketing Campaigns</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What used to rely primarily on paper flyers being sent out in the mail can now be received directly through email. Capturing your client's email addresses provides an opportunity for you to instantly send them promotional, relevant, entertaining, or informative emails.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Engaging prospective and present customers through email keeps your business relevant to them. The email should have clear calls-to-action (CTAs). This is the purpose of the email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would you like the email recipient to download something, respond or purchase something? An email campaign is a grouping of emails that are sent out at specific times and days. Email campaigns should be well planned and strategic to have the most successful open rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Open rates will track how many of the email recipients open your email. A click-through rate (CTR) compares the amount of clicked links to the number of subscribers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When creating an email, whether it be a newsletter or advertisement, it is essential to have a strong subject line that intrigues the recipient to open, read and click any available links.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Online marketing</strong>&nbsp;through email allows&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/">home service businesses</a>&nbsp;to stay top-of-mind with past customers and nurture relationships with potential ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Strategic Content Development</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Website content comes in several forms, and it can be a photo, audio, or video file. It can also be published items such as written information. Your&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/plumber-website-design/">website content</a>&nbsp;should balance images and text to ensure that the information displayed is understandable and appealing to the eye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Online marketing</strong>&nbsp;content includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Blog posts that demonstrate your expertise</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Service pages that clearly explain your offerings</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Case studies that showcase your successful projects</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Testimonials that build trust with potential customers</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Videos that demonstrate your services in action</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anything that directs someone to view your webpage and engage with your business will help your growth trajectory. Content is the foundation of&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;because it serves both your audience and search engines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social Media Engagement</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media is growing in popularity as an&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;tool, especially if you are aiming for a broader demographic. Popular social media platforms include Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, and others. Businesses can use these platforms to share content in the form of posts, stories, and videos and give the recipient of the information a chance to interact with your business and share it with others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media provides an opportunity for your business to be shared between users on whichever platform being used. Businesses can increase their social media presence by offering promotions for "sharing" or "liking" their posts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/plumber-digital-marketing-agency/">home service companies</a>, social media can be particularly effective for:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Sharing before/after photos of completed projects</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Posting quick tips and maintenance advice</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Announcing seasonal specials or promotions</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Responding to customer questions and feedback</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Building a community around your brand</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people, whether on their phone or computer, will search for services or products they need as a first attempt for an answer.&nbsp;<strong>Online marketing</strong>&nbsp;utilizes Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to keep your business as a top result when associated phrases or keywords are searched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The better ranking your business is within the search engine, the closer to the top of the list that your business will be. In addition, SEO makes your business visible online, directing traffic to your website, services and/or products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SEO is about tracking your content and website in search engines, primarily Google. When a prospective customer types in certain keywords into their preferred search engine, you want your business to be included in the results. This is what&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/plumber-seo/">SEO services</a>&nbsp;do for businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your business will have coordinating keywords that will be associated with your services, and a good SEO marketing plan will help your business be at the top of the list. SEO relies on creating content that has the right keywords being used and high-quality links built into the content to help it track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which Online Marketing Approaches Work Best?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditional and&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;are both critical for the success of a business. A few things that affect which to invest in are your business type and the demographics of your customer base. If most of your customers are younger, reaching them through social media may be more helpful than printed materials. If your customers are older and less likely to have an online presence, a more traditional route may help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, most everyone uses the internet to find information about anything and everything these days, which is why&nbsp;<strong>online marketing</strong>&nbsp;is becoming the dominant approach for most businesses, including home service companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to recent research:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>97% of consumers search online for local businesses</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>70% of home service customers check online reviews before making contact</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Email marketing delivers an average ROI of $36 for every $1 spent</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><a href="https://therebelape.com/local-seo-services-increase-local-visibility-and-drive-more-customers/">Local SEO</a> is particularly effective for service businesses that operate in specific geographic areas</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
