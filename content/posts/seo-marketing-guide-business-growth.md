<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SEO marketing</strong>&nbsp;is a non-negotiable if you want your website to be seen by... well, anyone. But it is also constantly evolving, and can get really confusing. We get that. That's why we're coming at you with important things to keep in mind when optimizing your website with search engine optimization. From making the most of keywords, to generating helpful content, to making sure you're running with a good neighborhood, here are ways you can win with&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SEO Marketing for Business Growth – Step-by-Step</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make The Best Use Of Your Keywords in SEO Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engine optimization, or&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>, is the process of improving the visibility of a website in search engine results pages. One important part of&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>&nbsp;is using the right keywords throughout your site, in order to signal to search engines what certain pages are about. Without keywords, it would be very difficult for people to find your site when they are searching for information online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google, in particular, relies heavily on keywords when determining which sites to show in its search results. That's why it's so important to include relevant keywords on your&nbsp;<a href="/services/website-design/">business website</a>&nbsp;if you want to rank high in Google's search results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It goes something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A person will ask a question on a search engine. With or without realizing it, they were using keywords when asking.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The search engine hears what the person is asking, then scours the internet to find the websites that most closely answer that question (i.e. the posts that most clearly and deeply expound upon said keywords).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Those websites are then ranked how well they answer these questions (with other factors like authority and traffic being taken into account) and presented to the searcher.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Refusing to use keywords in your&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>&nbsp;is like being on a deserted island with a box full of flares, but instead trying to get a ship's attention by just waving your hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When It Comes To Keywords in SEO Marketing, More Is Not Always Better</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know what they say, too much of a good thing...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keywords are great, and essential for climbing the ranks of&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>. But that does not mean that the best strategy is to stuff a page full of keywords and let it do the work, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The truth? Not so much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SEO marketing</strong>&nbsp;is also a complex and ever-changing field, which makes it difficult to know how many keywords you should use. If you use too many keywords, your content will be difficult to read and you will be penalized by search engines. On the other hand, if you don't use enough keywords, your content will be buried in the search results. The key is to find a balance between the two. In general, aim for a keyword density of about 1-2%. This will ensure that your content is SEO-friendly and easy to read.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Content Is King in Effective SEO Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>&nbsp;tactics that you can use to dominate your niche, but it's important not just to focus on keywords. You also need well-written content that actually answers the questions people are asking! Otherwise all those seeds will dry out before anything grows – and this wastes both time and money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google is all about making information accessible. In fact, their mission statement is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." This means that when they are determining which sites will rank higher and lower, just having keywords without good writing isn't enough. You need to be able to answer questions with specific answers with in-depth and well-researched information. The better you can elaborate, the better your chances of ranking higher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So how can you win with content in your&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Be clear and direct, answering the question quickly. But also make sure you elaborate and expand upon it. The average length is around 1,500+ words per post for&nbsp;<a href="/services/">home service businesses</a>, but some can stretch 2,000 to even 4,000 words.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Be entertaining, and have fun with it. But don't sound so much like a novel that your readers are left thinking, "Where was the answer to my question in all that fluff?"</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Include relevant visual content that enhances understanding and increases time on page.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stay In Good Neighborhoods for Successful SEO Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know the phrase, "You're most like the 5 people you spend the most time with?" When it comes to web-pages, that phrase holds true and it can have an effect on your ranking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How's that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those sites you link to become the "neighborhood" where your website will live in the eyes of <strong>SEO marketing</strong> algorithms. The more authoritative the other sites, the better the neighborhood that Google will come to associate you with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Industry experts revealed two things that Google will take into account when it comes to the pages you link to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Whether or not your links are associated with the content you're producing.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>How high quality or authoritative the sites are that you're linking to.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You definitely want the pages you've linked to relate to the content you're writing about. Believe it or not, Google will actually look into that, and if it sees that the page you're drawing from actually supports the point you're trying to make, then that's bonus points for you. If not, it looks like spamming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So how do you make sure you're in good neighborhoods for effective&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>? Don't worry, it's not difficult:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Audit your pages on SEO platforms. Usually these come with features that will indicate toxic pages you've been linking to and subsequently damaging your own ranks.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>When writing articles and blog posts, link to well-known authoritative sites. Industry publications, government resources, educational institutions, and established industry leaders. Find the authorities in your field and use them as your sources. They are long-established, distinguished, and healthy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Keep in mind not to go overboard on the links. Too many and search engines will think you're a spammer and will penalize you by sending you further down the ranks. While there's no specifically stated ideal number, settle for an average of around 3-5 external links per 1,000 words of content.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Technical SEO Marketing Factors You Can't Ignore</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond content and keywords, the technical aspects of&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>&nbsp;are increasingly important:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Website Speed and Mobile Optimization in SEO Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>User experience factors like page load speed and mobile responsiveness are now critical ranking factors. Google's Core Web Vitals assess how quickly your pages load, how soon they become interactive, and how stable they are as they load.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For&nbsp;<a href="/services/plumber-digital-marketing-agency/">home service businesses</a>, optimizing these factors is essential:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Compress images without sacrificing quality</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Minimize CSS and JavaScript files</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ensure your site is fully responsive on all devices</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Eliminate unnecessary plugins that slow down performance</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Local SEO Marketing for Service-Based Businesses</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you operate in a specific geographic area, local&nbsp;<strong>SEO marketing</strong>&nbsp;is particularly important. This includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Creating and optimizing your Google Business Profile</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Ensuring NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across all online directories</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Generating authentic local reviews</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Creating location-specific content</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Building local backlinks from community organizations</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
