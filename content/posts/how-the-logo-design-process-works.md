How The Logo Design Process Works

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The logo design process can seem like a mystery to those who don’t regularly work in design. In fact, most people might think that the design process is simply a matter of sketching a new idea! The process of creating an excellent design for a business is much more complicated than this. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, understanding the steps involved in the design process can make it much easier to obtain the best design for your preferences and your situation. The process may fluctuate slightly depending on the scope of the project. Factors that may impact the overall design process include how many comps you would like initially, if you would like us to build additional marketing elements, and a few other considerations. However, in general, the process can be narrowed down to a few simple steps. </p>

<h2>The Importance of a Great Logo</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is absolutely vital for a business to obtain a great logo to represent their brand. In most situations, the design is the most easily recognizable portion of the company’s entire branding strategy. It can be tempting for new business owners to forgo the expense of obtaining a great logo with the thought that they can simply get a better logo when their business takes off. Unfortunately, this can be detrimental to the company’s reputation. Rebranding can be very difficult, especially when a change is involved. When done incorrectly, rebranding can lose customers and tarnish your company’s image.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order for a&nbsp;<a href="/branding-strategies-in-marketing/">branding strategy</a>&nbsp;to be effective, it has to be consistent. Consistency will signal to your customers that you are steady and reliable. Not only must the&nbsp;<a href="/success-business-branding/">branding be consistent</a>, but it must also be done well. Inadequate or poorly executed <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="/logo-design/"   title="logo design" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">logo design</a> may cause potential customers to assume that your products or services will be similarly inadequate. Your logo will ultimately be the face of your company. It will be present on advertisements, business cards, letterheads, and even the front door of your office. Taking the time to obtain superior logo design services can save you a significant amount of stress in the long run.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Logo Design Process</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you have chosen a&nbsp;<a href="/how-to-hire-a-logo-designer/">logo designer</a>&nbsp;for your project, the design process will commence. We have outlined the design process to ensure that you understand how the project will proceed from this point. Knowing how the design process works can help ensure that you remain involved and obtain the final product that you desire. Here at Rebel Ape Marketing, we offer free initial design consultations. This will allow us to begin the project on the same page and make sure that we understand exactly what you need.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. Design Consultation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first step in the design process is the design consultation. During this step, we will discuss the scope of the project with you. This helps to ensure that both parties are on the same page and that we understand precisely what you are looking for. With the design consultation, we will discuss what kind of design you require. We will ask questions regarding who the design is for to help us best understand how to craft a design that will meet your needs. At this point, we will also likely discuss how you intend to use your design, as well as a possible branding strategy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your needs may be as immediate as a logo for your business or a more long-term branding process. Implementing the right&nbsp;<a href="/how-to-design-a-brand-identity-like-a-professional/">brand strategy</a> can help to ensure that your business maintains the image you desire and inspires loyalty in your customers. This step is also important in determining the exact requirements for the logo. This can ensure that the logo can be used wherever you need it to, whether you require it to fit on a banner or a shirt.</p>

<h3>2. Discovery Phase</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After we have discussed the details of the project, we can move into the discovery phase. During this phase, we draw out many different preliminary designs. This is essentially a phase of experimentation, where we try many different strategies and techniques to craft a design that captures the intended look and mood. A <a href="https://looka.com/logo-ideas/">great logo</a> can say many different things about a company, so we take the time to craft possibilities that will help you ensure that your logo makes the statement that you desire for your company. </p>

<h3>3. Refinement</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the discovery phase, we begin the refinement process. This is where the preliminary concepts become more detailed and advanced. We refine our initial comps and take them into the computer, which is where we can build an early version of the logo. During this step, we experiment with colors and fonts to craft the superior look for the final logo. This step of the process is also where we build the structure for the logo.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Presentation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the initial logo concepts have been developed and refined, we present the logos to you. We choose logo ideas that will work best for your particular company and the brand you wish to develop. After you have selected a design that you love, we provide you with multiple formats for the design’s application. This will include formats for both online uses, as well as print applications. This will ensure that you are able to use your new logo in whatever format you require. &nbsp;</p>
