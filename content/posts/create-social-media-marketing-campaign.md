# How To Create A Great Social Media Marketing Campaign

Get started with a great social media marketing campaign. As the ad adage goes, **content is king**—truer now than it has ever been. Content is being created at an astounding rate.

[Here are a few stats](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/#547fd45360ba) from some of the most-used social media platforms in 2017: every minute, Snapchat users share 527,760 photos, users send 456,000 tweets on Twitter, and Instagram users post 46,740 photos.

## Starting A Social Media Marketing Campaign

Even though content is still king, content has to be seen to pass along a message. If it never reaches your audience, you won’t get a reliable measurement of its quality. This is why every great campaign starts with a well-planned strategy.

Strategy can make or break your entire campaign. Low-quality content can succeed with great strategy, while high-quality content can fail with poor—or nonexistent—strategy.

Here’s our approach to creating a great [social media marketing campaign](https://therebelape.com/5-reasons-you-need-social-media-marketing/).

### Goal Setting To Test Social Media

The first step is often the most important. By setting goals, you define exactly what you want your social media campaign to achieve.

Your goals should be ambitious but realistic. For example, gaining a million Twitter followers in a month is not a practical goal.

Choose one broad but targeted goal for the campaign, then define smaller, incremental goals that act as stepping stones toward the main objective.

**Examples of campaign goals:**

- Increase brand awareness  
- Acquire new customers  
- Improve sales  
- Increase engagement  
- Reach a new audience  

Once your goals are set, you can map out the rest of your strategy.

### Thorough Research

To execute your strategy effectively, you need to understand your audience as deeply as possible. While there are no shortcuts, several tools can make this easier.

Platforms like [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/) and [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/) allow you to monitor conversations, schedule posts, and analyze engagement patterns.

These tools help identify which channels your audience is most active on and the best ways to reach them. In-depth research reveals which platforms and ad placements have the highest likelihood of success.

### Analyze, Analyze, Analyze!

After setting goals and researching your audience, it’s time to act. If your target demographic heavily favors one platform, that’s a strong signal that ads may perform well there.

[Facebook Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads) simplifies the process by guiding you from objective selection to budgeting, ad formats, and performance measurement.

Once the campaign is live, continuous monitoring is essential. Strategy doesn’t end at launch—you should regularly optimize and refine the campaign to improve performance.

Ongoing analysis ensures you get the most value from your budget.
