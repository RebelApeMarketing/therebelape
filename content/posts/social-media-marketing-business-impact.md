The Critical Business Impact of Social Media Marketing in 2025

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an increasingly tech-savvy world, social media has weaved itself into our lives in ways we would never have thought possible. Just as it has provided opportunities like never before to connect with one another, it has also provided a brand new platform on which to market your business. As its popularity soars, businesses must recognize the imperative of engaging in&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's be honest, in many ways, social media is the new "getting up in the morning and reading the paper." For most people, they start off each day opening up one of the many platforms and scrolling through photos, videos, and status updates, completely inundated with likes, comments, and shares.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has only grown since it first started, and it hasn't shown signs of slowing down, which is why many companies have seen it as an opportunity to promote themselves on a whole other platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some businesses, however, tend to see&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;as expendable, a side of marketing that won't really have an effect on their overall profitability. But in reality, avoiding social media could be holding you back from gaining customers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Your Target Audience Using Social Media Marketing Platforms? Survey Says: Yes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certain business owners resist engaging in&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>, fearing it might be fruitless. Surprisingly, almost 40% of small businesses avoid using social media in their marketing efforts, according to recent studies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps past attempts yielded underwhelming outcomes, leading to the assumption that their audience isn't present. Alternatively, they might have acquired more business through word of mouth than through likes and shares.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless of the rationale, some businesses abstain from&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;under the assumption that their audience lacks activity there. Yet, the statistics tell a different story:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Studies show that as of 2025, over 4.5 billion people globally use at least one social media platform. That is 1.5 billion more than in 2017. And there are estimates that there will be as many as 5 billion users by 2028. This tells us that your target audience is almost certainly found among those numbers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Recent reports show that roughly 70% of adults in the U.S. are Facebook users. According to industry data, over 60% of smartphone users in the U.S. are active on Instagram.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Speaking of Facebook, 75% of "business-to-consumer" marketers have found customers because of that platform.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>What's more, an astounding 92% of people ages 18–29 are social media users, 85% of those aged 30-49, an impressive 78% of those aged 50–64, and still a significant 52% of those aged 65 and older.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Underestimating the power of&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;could hinder you from connecting with your most loyal customers. Embracing it unlocks new opportunities for your&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/">home service business</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Social Media Marketing Can Do For Your Business</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When considering&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;for your business, the potential rewards far surpass the risks. Building your business's presence on these platforms offers significant advantages you can't afford to miss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Larger Potential For Sales Through Social Media Marketing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn have grown increasingly popular for those in the market for just about anything, including home services. Businesses that use these platforms to their advantage have been surprised by the results:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Current statistics show that 82% of salespeople who use&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;outsell those who don't.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Meanwhile, 78% of marketers view selling on social media as anywhere from "somewhat effective" to "very effective" for their businesses.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Overall, over 65% of consumers utilize social media when researching service providers, often browsing through a company's feed when deciding who to hire.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Promoting your company through&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;will give potential customers a chance to connect and help foster the relationship needed to compel them to choose your services over competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social Media Marketing Helps Turn Your Business Into A Recognizable Brand</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider your favorite brands—ones that are instantly recognizable without explicit mention.&nbsp;<strong>Social media marketing</strong>can guide your&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/plumber-logo-design-service/">company's brand identity</a>&nbsp;toward that level of recognition. While it takes time (even major brands didn't achieve instant renown), the investment is valuable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to distinguish between marketing and branding. Marketing presents offers to drive sales, while branding shapes how the company appears to the public. Marketing showcases products and services; branding focuses on logos, fonts, and designs for recognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media provides an ideal canvas for branding, particularly as many platforms revolve around visuals. Leverage this chance to craft posts that familiarize potential customers with your brand and establish your company as a leader in the&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/website-design/">home service industry</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social Media Marketing Helps You Provide Responsive Customer Service</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key to successful&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;is being personal, and this technique will cost you 30 seconds of your time. Your audience consists of real people with problems that need solutions from companies like yours, so make sure they feel valued by answering their questions in a prompt and engaging way!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some tips for responsive&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>We all know that customers are more likely to leave a positive review if they feel like their questions were answered quickly and efficiently. So don't get caught up in the moment; take care of those who left you feedback or asked you questions by replying within 24 hours.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The average response time from businesses on Facebook is just over 24 hours. But get this: a substantial 85% of customers expect a response within 6 hours.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>On Instagram, 78% of users prefer to return to business pages that are more active. The usual recommendation is to respond within an hour for optimal engagement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;allows you to demonstrate your commitment to customer service publicly, showing potential clients how responsive and attentive your business is before they even contact you.</p>
