4 Proven Strategies to Maximize Your Social Media Marketing ROI

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's be real, it can sometimes feel impossible to get noticed on social media. So many people are using it, and when you do post, you get a maximum of 10 likes… and most of those are from your relatives or old high school buddies. It's usually around that time that the classic question starts to slip in, "Why bother?" Here's why: Because&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;success is possible, if you go about it the right way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2025, the average person spends over 150 minutes (that's 2.5 hours!) on social media per day. For many people, it is the modern equivalent of waking up and reading the newspaper. If you're like most Americans, you start your morning by reaching for your phone and scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or one of those other platforms. But what if when people opened their feed, they found content from your company?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are four proven ways to improve your chances of reaching the clients that are going to like, click, share, and (most importantly) convert into customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Optimize Your Profiles for Social Media Marketing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but it's important to put your best foot forward all the same. Because, often, a person will judge the quality of a business by the state of its social media profiles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting started on boosting the quality of your <strong>social media marketing</strong> is not difficult. There are simple steps you can take to improve your profile in order to get better results from <a href="https://therebelape.com/how-to-master-your-client-onboarding-process-from-3-hours-to-20-minutes/">potential clientele</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Make sure your brand name is clear.</strong>&nbsp;People need to be able to find you, and if they can't because your social media handle is different than your actual business name, then they're going to give up trying. Consistency across platforms is key for&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/plumber-logo-design-service/">brand recognition</a>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Pay attention to the quality of your profile picture.</strong>&nbsp;Nobody wants to see a grainy or blurred photo or logo as the face of your company. Make the effort to use a clear and professional image so that you can show that you are proud of who you are. For&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/">home service businesses</a>, this might be your logo or a professional headshot of the owner.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Give people a place to buy.</strong>&nbsp;In your bio, include a link to your company website. You want to give them a way to get to that "contact us" button, and it's easier to hit a link than it is to get out of the app, open the browser, type it in, then hit enter. The less effort you can ask of potential customers, the more easily they will reach out. Make sure your&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/website-design/">website is optimized</a>&nbsp;to convert this traffic.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Complete every possible field.</strong>&nbsp;Fill out your business hours, location, services offered, and contact information. The more complete your profile, the more professional you appear and the easier it is for customers to take action.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Embrace New Features in Your Social Media Marketing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Social media platforms are constantly evolving. Take Instagram for example – at first, you had the option of posting either photo or video, but then stories became a thing, then "carousels," then IGTV videos, then Reels. Now, the platform is very different from when it started, offering many more features than it used to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shunning these new features of&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;lowers your chances, if anything, of being found. Instead, you should be taking full advantage of them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Social media platforms want people using their new features. Therefore, their algorithms (the system by which they decide how much your page is shown) prioritize pages that use them.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Early adopters of new features often see a temporary boost in visibility as platforms promote the new functionality.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Different features reach different audience segments – some prefer quick video content while others engage more with longer form posts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rule of thumb is that when a platform releases a new feature, explore it, get to know it, and brainstorm how you can incorporate it into your content. The more readily you embrace it, the more you can get on the forefront of the wave of users picking it up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/plumber-digital-marketing-agency/">home service businesses</a>, this might mean using Instagram Stories to show before/after project results, creating TikTok tutorials for simple home maintenance, or using LinkedIn's newsletter feature to share industry expertise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Engage Authentically With Social Media Marketing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is one of the simplest but most effective&nbsp;<strong>social media marketing</strong>&nbsp;techniques you can take to heart, and at most it will cost 30 seconds of your time. Your audience are real people with real questions and real problems that you, as a company, are setting out to solve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many factors taken into account by social media platforms when deciding how much you should be shown to your followers. One of the most major determining bits of criteria is how much people engage with you. In other words, the more people like, comment, and share your posts, the more the platform will see, "Oh, people want to see this," and the more exposure you will receive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>One of the number one ways to encourage that kind of engagement is to engage in return:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If somebody comments on your post, respond within 24 hours. The majority of consumers expect a fast response time.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The average company response time on Facebook is just over 24 hours. However, an exponential 85% of customers expect a response within 6 hours.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>With Instagram, 78% of users are more inclined to turn to business pages that are more active. The general recommendation? Respond within an hour.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To encourage more commenting, incorporate a question into your response. (i.e. "Hey, we're so glad you had great service! Was there anything in particular that you enjoyed?") You'll make them feel like you really care about what they have to say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Successful social media marketing isn't just about broadcasting messages—it's about building relationships.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Use Strong Calls-to-Action in Social Media Marketing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can tell your audience about all the benefits of your service, but if you don't call them to take action, they're not going to move. Any professional marketer will tell you the exact same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You could be a plumbing company that offers the world's best drain cleaning service, and you can totally do a post talking about how fast and thorough your service is, or how your specialized equipment can handle even the toughest clogs without damaging pipes. But here's the deal: Your audience is going to read that and think, "That's great… So what?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Remember, be bold about calls to action in your social media marketing.</strong>&nbsp;This is where you're telling your customers how to get the service that is going to solve their problem:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>"Call now for emergency service!"</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>"Schedule an appointment today!"</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>"Get your free estimate!"</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>"Tap the link in our bio to learn more!" (Just make sure that link in your bio actually has to do with the post.)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You want people to contact you, don't you? The truth is, even if they want to, many won't until you tell them exactly how.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different calls-to-action work better for different stages of the&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/services/plumber-digital-marketing-agency/">customer journey</a>. For awareness content, "Learn more" might be appropriate, while consideration content might use "See our work," and decision-stage content should use more direct CTAs like "Call now."</p>
