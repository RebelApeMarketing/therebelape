How Professional Content Writing Transforms Your Business Authority

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about this: When was the last time a question popped into your head, so you looked it up online and found lists and pages of articles and posts with answers? Probably pretty recently, right? You can thank&nbsp;<strong>professional content writing</strong>&nbsp;for those lists and pages and articles and posts. When you're looking for DIY fixes for broken plumbing and find a step-by-step guide, when you want to grow your local business and find a tips-and-tricks article, when you want to know how to choose the best contractor and find a definitive checklist, you can thank writers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In marketing, there are few, if any, aspects that a writer does not have his or her fingers in. Whether it be websites and SEO, video, social media; if there are words, there's a writer somewhere on that line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Professional content writing</strong>&nbsp;serves a wide range of purposes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Builds authority for your brand, which establishes trust and credibility with potential customers</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Entertains and educates your audience, keeping readers engaged and coming back for more</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Works closely with SEO to get your brand in front of more potential customers</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Creates conversion-focused copy that turns website visitors into paying clients</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to marketing your home service business, the need for&nbsp;<strong>professional content writing</strong>&nbsp;cannot be overstated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Professional Content Writing Transforms You Into An Industry Authority</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless of what form of business you deal in, you want to be the expert that people turn to. Of course you do, because when you show your audience that you know what you're talking about, the odds go up that they're going to turn to you more often when they have questions. Eventually, that trust you build increases the potential for sales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to becoming an industry leader,&nbsp;<strong>professional content writing</strong>&nbsp;does much of the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Consistently produces content that answers questions and educates readers, showing your business as a one-stop-shop for relevant information</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Painstakingly performs research to back up their writing with sources, building your credibility as an expert in your industry</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Creates comprehensive resources that demonstrate your deep understanding of customer problems and solutions</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the amazing thing is, you can apply this to practically any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/">home service business</a>. If you run a plumbing company, a writer can help you become an authority in water conservation and home maintenance. For an HVAC business, a writer will help you establish yourself as the expert on indoor air quality and energy efficiency. If you offer home remodeling, a writer can make you the go-to resource for design trends and material selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of this and more shows customers that not only do you perform a service, you also know how to elevate it to the next level. This can have customers not only coming to your business, but also coming back and referring others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Professional Content Writing Makes Your Business Visible</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google's mission statement reads as follows: "Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search engines, like Google, are there to take the questions people are asking, gather content that seeks to answer those questions, and present it to the searcher. Specifically, they place the content that is most relevant and most valuable near the top.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So what does this have to do with&nbsp;<strong>professional content writing</strong>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting to that top spot is vital to gaining traction as a company, and it takes a lot of work. Writers and&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/plumber-seo/">SEO experts</a>&nbsp;put their heads together to generate content that, among other things, is relevant and informative. This increases your chances of search engines, particularly Google, ranking you higher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why is ranking so important?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Statistics have shown that the first Google search result receives 28% of all clicks. The second result receives only 15.7%. The third result gets an average of 11%. The results only get lower from there. This means that the lower you rank, the less of a chance you will be seen at all</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Google owns an astounding almost 92% of the worldwide search engine market. The next highest search engine would be Bing, with only a 2.86% hold of the market. Given these statistics, it becomes clearer how much of an effect ranking higher can have on traffic for your business</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><em>Professional content writing</em>&nbsp;is your pathway to capturing this valuable search traffic and converting it into leads</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content writers and SEO experts help your&nbsp;<a href="https://therebelape.com/plumber-marketing-services/plumber-website-design/">website rank higher</a>&nbsp;by producing content that answers people's questions in a way that search engines can recognize and reward.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stories Created Through Professional Content Writing Drive Conversions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The majority of the time, writers are storytellers. That is a very useful skill in marketing. Doing so opens the door for your customers to connect on a deeper level with your service than they would by simply reading a list of features.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is one thing for a potential customer to read that your plumbing service offers 24/7 emergency response. But if you can craft a story whereby a family was spared the disaster of a flooded basement in the middle of the night because of your prompt service, you connect with your customer's desire for security, reliability, and peace of mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same holds true for just about any home service. Using&nbsp;<strong>professional content writing</strong>&nbsp;to tell a story in which your service helps a customer overcome the problem that has been causing them stress is a surefire way to make them seriously consider doing business with you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Professional content writers</strong>&nbsp;work hard to hone their skills as storytellers in order to cast your business as the solution to your potential customer's problems. That puts you on the path towards being first in the minds of potential clients when they need your services.</p>
